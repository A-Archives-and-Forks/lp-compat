The last couple months tho have been upsetting because the game would often glitch and crash resulting in stuff I earned to not be there next I open the app. I updated it recently and it was smooth sailing for a week and now it\'s starting to crash again.","Disclaimer that I played this game to receive rewards in a different game. It was fun, and I was able to acquire 100 dragons within the time limit in order to receive all rewards. Overall totally recommend this game (rewards or not). I especially like the levels and other side games, where other merge games only have the \\"camp\\" aspect. What I don\'t like is the graphics aren\'t that great, and when collecting items it usually puts them in random places rather than near similar ones.","I really enjoy this game... It\'s something I do while I listen to audiobooks \ud83d\ude05 I DO wish we had the options of having an inventory of special/hard to achieve items without cluttering our land or having to sell the item off.i feel like that would be an awesome improvement. The game makers have always been very responsive to my issues I\'ve had over the years I\'ve been playing (at least 3 significant problems arose that they fixed for me).","I really liked this game a while back but had to stop. I came back after a long hiatus and still enjoy it. One problem that was not remedied by the latest fix is the saves. Not only is my previous game not saved, but errors in coins and bricks in my little vaults are showing up as well. I spend the coins and bricks, but what I purchased has mysteriously vanished from my previous game. Not cool.","I sporadically play. I\'ve noticed since this most recent update that merge chains are overly sensitive to trigger when I don\'t want them to (pulls items that are diagonal and not directly in contact for example). I\'ve also noticed that there is a lot more lag both in my camp and in level... but a LOT more during levels. These two issues are so frustrating that it impacts my ability to enjoy it."],"appId":"com.gramgames.mergedragons","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gramgames.mergedragons&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.turner.pocketmorties":{"title":"Rick and Morty: Pocket Mortys","description":"The #1 multi-dimensional grandson fighting simulator in the galaxy is back and better than ever!\\n\\nYou\u2019re Rick Sanchez, everyone\u2019s favorite unstable genius.

I have uninstalled and reinstalled three times already and I\'m still stuck on the loading screen and all it says is error it won\'t even let me start the game. At first it wasn\'t too big of an issue I had my highest level Morty was 21 so I haven\'t spent too much time in the game but still I\'ve been playing for a while and I had quite a few more of these captured like for ethics a lot of exotics a couple of rares and a lot of commons.","re-downloaded the game to get back into it, I missed the gameplay, it makes me feel nostalgic, and I enjoy it a lot. So, I think it\'s missing a key feature that would bring so many more competitive players to the game. The game relies on a 1v1 battle style, but can\'t it add so much more complex opportunities with a 2v2 setting? A rock type vs a scissors type shows a clear advantage, but add paper to scissors team, and another rock type with rock, and it becomes much more challenging! -S22 ultra","I loved the game 100% BUT I had to redownload it when I got a new phone and it won\'t let me choose either if the saved progresses it\'s found for me. When I press one of the saved progresses, it loads for a sec then goes back to the saved progress screen. I\'ve tried both and neither one works and I can\'t get into the game to reset. If the developers could fix so that I can log back in or reset for me, I\'ll start playing again.","Constant freezing & crashes. Doesn\'t matter if it\'s campaign or multiplayer mode, the end result is the same: GAME OVER. Super disappointing & no fix in sight. Why bother with it anymore? About to put this one back on the shelf. Last update was more than a month ago, it\'s like the developers don\'t care. Numerous unaddressed bugs. I\'m on a Samsung S21+ with latest system updates, as well as latest app version. Can\'t believe the app performs so poorly on a device with such great hardware.","Great game when it works. Recently it has this crashing bug in Android. If you try to open the game, especially multiplayer, it just crashes and closes out. Last time I fixed it by uninstalling and then reinstalling, but it\'s happening again. I really hope they can fix this since it\'s super inconvenient to keep uninstalling."],"appId":"com.turner.pocketmorties","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.turner.pocketmorties&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.ludia.dragons":{"title":"Dragons: Rise of Berk","description":"Build your OWN Berk!

Without the fancy dragon rider\'s pass it can take a bit of time to advance but it\'s still possible which is nice! That said it\'s a little disappointing that so many features are only for dragon riders because I\'ve played for so long (I remember back when the original character huts were added) so I wish that the og players could get some kind of bonus without paying a ton but otherwise it\'s definitely a game worth getting. :)","So far it\'s a pleasant enough experience. There\'s a nice variety of dragons, you can name them, etc. My main complaint is that the game crashes pretty frequently. Not sure if anyone else has this problem, but I\'m lucky if a single session lasts longer than 5 minutes. UPDATE: game now crashes completely, deleting other apps and clearing my cache doesn\'t work. I really want to play this game, but it just refuses to work.","This game is probably my favorite out of all my other games. It has high quality and outstanding graphics. There is always something to do while your waiting for something like, Brawling, defending berk, ect... Also there\'s varieties of dragons to unlock and it never forces you to watch ads. It sometimes crashes but aside from that, great game. \ud83d\udc4d","Dragons: Rise of Berk is a very slow, very grindy game. I\'ve been playing for 2 years and only unlocked 1 out of 10 legendary dragons. If you can get past that, there are some really great things to this game. The detail in the dragons and the island is great, and there is always something to work towards. My favorite part is that this game is purchase oriented, not ad oriented. It will never force you to watch an ad, though it does have a number of pop-ups and alerts for buying passes or packs.","I genuinely love this game so much, the designs are great, the dragons themselves are even better, and I just can\'t wait to see more! However, I recently experienced a bug that didnt allow me to play the game for about 15 seconds, every time I touched the screen, the Dragon Riders subscription thing would pop up. I am not at all trying to say that the devs are forcing people to buy it, and I am 100% sure its just a bug, but it could use some patching :]"],"appId":"com.ludia.dragons","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ludia.dragons&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.ludia.jurassicworld":{"title":"Jurassic World\u2122: The Game","description":"Return to Isla Nublar with the creators of the smash hit Jurassic Park\u2122 Builder for your next adventure: Jurassic World\u2122: The Game, the official mobile game based on this summer\u2019s epic action-adventure.

The visuals are very nice. Plenty to do from mission completion, to battles, decorating and etc. Game lags here and there but not too much. My issue are the crashes. The game crashes every time I play. Sometimes as soon as it loads into the game it\'ll crash. It\'s crashed 5 times back to back as soon as it loaded, on the 6th try I finally got to play. This game is really nice, and I don\'t plan to stop because of the crashing. It\'s just annoying, but hopefully can be fixed!","The game is really cool and fun to play. However it crashes way to much, mostly when in battles. Once you get to higher level and unlock more park expansion(which should cost coins) it doesn\'t work and makes you use the cash(dollars). Please fix the game. Its great! Would give 5 stars if it didn\'t crash so much.","Love game but getting frustrated. Now can only use dino cash to buy land expansion. It gets where only way to finish task you have spend a lot of money. I have bought passes and etc. But I can\'t always. I have lost battles from glitches . No other games I play does this. So it not my connection. Try reaching out for support and no response of yet. My screen is sometimes blacked out and land expansion shows no cost . If I am able to get it ,I need 200 in dino bucks. Please fix the bugs in game!!!","Constant crashes sometimes at random but they typically occur upon trying to load the game are after watching an ad, also unrelated but I don\'t like how theve locked everything behind \\"special events\\" or pay walls, you used to be able to get most dinosaurs via progression in the battle arena but that doesn\'t seem to be the case anymore. Either way though that\'s been my experience with this game","Will I love the game but for some reason now it crashes every time it opens. So it\'s getting 2 star. I\'ll make it 5 when it stops crashing every 5 seconds into the game. Great visuals, great play time, not long wait periods, and not to many ads unless you want to watch them to speed up or something."],"appId":"com.ludia.jurassicworld","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ludia.jurassicworld&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.ironhidegames.android.kingdomrush":{"title":"Kingdom Rush- Tower Defense TD","description":"Charge into the action in this classic Tower Defense TD game!

Amusing character design, bits of dialogue, and appearance. You do have to consider what towers, upgrades, and specializations will help you win. Plenty of upgrades and helpful equipment to buy. I liked trying to get three stars (for upgrades) and gems (for coins, lives, bombs) on every scenario and never used payments to get the other heroes or conveniences. Great timepass during the past month. When I finish this game I will happily buy the next installment.","I had never heard of this game before, but oh man was I impressed with the sales model... It didn\'t prompt me every 5 seconds to spend money. I beat the game and got every star possible without ever spending anything, big props. As far as the gameplay goes it is a tower defense same with hints of rts unit control mixed in. It makes the game more interactive but can be frustrating at times. Overall I am very happy with this game and buying the next in the series.","This is a great games with no ads whatsoever (other than to get gems for free) also the fact you have a chance to have sheep blow up if really funny. It has hours of gameplay and has many ways to give yourself a challenge. Also endless is really fun to play and beat your old highscore! But it would be cool to see a progress bar for achievements but other than that there isn\'t much room to inprove but it was a really fun game. Also getting stars to upgrade towers is really cool!","This sentence was not written by a NPC. This amazing game is about tower defense genre and more! It has unique art stlye, and has many diffrent variations of levels each containing new bosses and new lesson which the game teaches you, i\'ll elaborate by adding that some levels have multiple styles which complicated the objective. By the way~ During the Spetember 11\'th 2001 terrorist attack, 2996 lives we\'re lost! This was named 9/11 soon after the twin towers fell.","This is one of the now classic great Tower Defense games on mobile. And it\'s free too these days since they\'ve released two newer versions of it with KR: Frontiers and KR: Origins. Not to mention the Scifi version Iron Marines. Which all of those are great too. Although I do find the micro-transactions in them on mobile annoying, they\'re not intrusive or convoluted like most mobile games. As a note all of them are also available on Steam for PC for purchase with everything unlocked. Great game!\u2764"],"appId":"com.ironhidegames.android.kingdomrush","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ironhidegames.android.kingdomrush&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.ironhidegames.android.ironmarines":{"title":"Iron Marines: RTS offline Game","description":"From the minds behind the highly acclaimed Kingdom Rush td saga, comes the most action packed sci fi RTS: Iron Marines.

I bought this game when I was 10 years old and I had a lot of fun with it (4 years ago) I see a lot of people talking about difficulty and stuff but I\'m pretty sure you can change difficulty, and I never had a problem with it even when playing on normal, some levels will be hard because it\'s a strategy game not casual. (Also probably just a skill issue) Really nice storyline and great gameplay! Never bought anything except a hero either so it\'s not that hard.","Perfect Mobile Strategy Game! What a gem to find a strategy game that works well with mobile, offers decent paid upgrades buy isn\'t pay to win (the upgrades are just new captains), and a challenging series of maps as well as a TON of achievements. I just finished all the achievements and I absolutely love all easter eggs and how much was put into the game. I hope for more like it in the future. My only criticism is some of the paid captains aren\'t very good. Blue Dragon is great though!!","I really like how you can upgrade the heros and have a tech tree, I like that there are two different currency\'s in the game, I think it adds some challenge, especially if you don\'t use your coin abilitys wisely, it adds some planing to it instead of using them all over, and the bosses are challenging but beatable if you look at the patterens, overall a very good game. ( I don\'t get all the people saying they can\'t beat the bosses, I take them out quite quickly, then again I play alot)","Fantastic game design, however the difficulty curve is insane. A little too insane for my taste sadly. You end up being dependant on purchasing bombardments from the store to be able to get anywhere by the 3rd mission, but you never have enough because you have to use them so often just so you dont get overwhelmed. Not a game for casual players, and not worth the money i spent.","Honestly the game play is great and I\'m a huge fan of Ironhide games but that 4th mission, Unto The Breach, is ridiculously difficult. I tried everything multiple times, even going as far as turning the difficulty to easy but to no avail. I really wish I could get past it because I want to play the rest of the game but i guess I\'ll just stick to the kingdom rush series."],"appId":"com.ironhidegames.android.ironmarines","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ironhidegames.android.ironmarines&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.Gcenter.DefenselegendX.TowerDefense.TD":{"title":"Defense Legend 4: Sci-Fi TD","description":"Being the next part of the series Games Defense Legend, Defense Legend 4 gives Players full of new interesting experiences.

Tower descriptions are often confusing (lightning tower \\"attaches bullets\\" to enemies?) or stupid (\\"slowly gun\\") or look like code. Things that you may like or dislike: hardest difficulty level is still easier than most game\'s normal mode, towers can be destroyed, and you can only put towers in predefined locations","Like it so far. Not the easiest but a good challenge. Have to figure some stuff out on your own because it doesn\'t really tell you much. Biggest complaint is that towers can be damaged/destroyed. You can\'t see all the field at once so you scroll down to place something, scroll back up and you\'ve lost a tower! It would be nice to put towers wherever you want instead of premarked locations also. Other than that, great graphics and fun to play.","Too much over there too graphics where you can\'t even tell what effect your choices are having. If you like being entertained not than engaged, you might like it more than I did. I like a clean game where I can calculate my choices and try out. The graphics in this game is pretty but make it chaotic and you can\'t really keep track of things.","Unfinished game. There are lots of things that simply not completed. 1. The Report Bug doesn\'t have a To email. 2. The menu red dots are inconstant. 3. There are Towers that don\'t have descriptions. Update: I would give it 0 starts. Starting at level 40, you have to complete ALL previous levels at ALL difficulties with PERFECT scores! Really?","How do these broken GD games get such high ratings? Don\'t trust anyone that has to cheat and pad their own ratings. This is so broken its nearly unplayable. By the 2nd level, much of the playing field is off the screen and you can\'t see the battle or place defense in all places. The screen won\'t move or adjust so you just see your defense firing into oblivion but don\'t fully see what\'s going on. It\'s clunky and not smooth mechanics. It\'s not terrible, but it\'s definitely nowhere near 4.9 stars."],"appId":"com.Gcenter.DefenselegendX.TowerDefense.TD","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Gcenter.DefenselegendX.TowerDefense.TD&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.Gcenter.Raid.Royal.TowerDefense.TD":{"title":"Raid Royal: Tower Defense","description":"Do you enjoy playing defense games?

Sometimes it requires patience, but that makes it easier to integrate into the rest of my life. I wish there was a single button (hit again to confirm) that would put it into pause mode and return to \\"desktop\\" without losing one\'s place in the game. In general, the battles are fun, and finding/achieving upgrades are satisfying, but sometimes frustrating. It has adequately filled the empty times in my life.","The gameplay mechanics are great. Combining tower types is a great ability that sets this game apart from other tower defense apps. I haven\'t felt any need to purchase anything so far in order to win, so that\'s a win. The downside is the grammar; sometimes the English translation is so bungled that you can\'t understand the directions. Doesn\'t make much of a difference on gameplay though, just makes the game feel cheaper.","As I fan of TD games I like this one but it has its issues. Great maps, worlds, towers, levels, heroes, and graphics. However it relies on ads waaaay too much and some levels/enemies are incredibly difficult to beat/kil and the heroes only gain experience if you beat the level (veeery slow progress at times.) Also there are too many options and spending money does not guarantee progress. The heroes to get are Satan, scorch blaze and Brion (I have not unlocked Waylin.) Don\'t get andor or cercle.","I want to see how much money and time the positive reviews spent on the game! One of the most egregious examples of forced pay to win I\'ve ever seen. On level 11 they have a map with an area your champion can\'t reach and there are not enough tower slots to stop the enemy mobs. The solution? Pay $0.99 to unlock a champion trapped in a cage up there. If that is not obvious enough, the cage bounces over and over during the match as you are losing, trying to get you to pay up before it\'s game over","Ok. People were complaining about unfair gameplay so I actually didn\'t spend a penny. (I usually get beginner packs and bonuses early since that\'s when they are most useful.) Yeah, it\'s tough but I went to 11 to see what the fuss was - yes you can cross the chasm with your hero. Just advance slowly. And you get the wolf free once you win that level.

I think it has potential. First of all, lower the cost of, everything... Make it easier to obtain items, heroes, magic and so on. When you first start playing, you get a nice win streak going on then, you hit a brick wall. Unless you play already completed levels a hundred times over to rack up some crystals, gems, items and etc. Or, of course, you pay to play. Also, when I direct my hero to move, why does he run half way then go back?!","Pay-To-Win: Name of this game is simple. If you want to make it past the first few levels, open your wallet. It is a well put together game with great design and mechanic choices. It\'s too bad it is impossible to get past level 14 without buying your victory. This is a fun way to pass a few hours, but you will quickly delete it unless you\'re willing to buy your way past the very apparent pay-wall.","Starts out pretty fun but the difficulty scales up ridiculously quite quickly as a clear play to push players into microtransactions to progress without extensive grinding of earlier levels to eke out a tiny bit of progress after days or weeks of playing the same missions repeatedly and constantly bombarding you with pop-ups for \\"deals\\" on premium currency, heroes, pets and so on. A good example is that you \\"unlock\\" pirate hero but it really just unlocks the ability to buy him. Trash.","The game is great, I enjoy it, and the ads are not invasive, but there is a very annoying bug... In the tournament supposed to be 100 levels. I got to 25 and the game just stops. If I get out of the mode, then I lose the progress. It is very annoying as I spent a lot of time on it. Also, it is not clear where and how to contact support if there is any.","Good but too many adds. Even the tutorial forces you to view pay only upgrades. There are adds and pay options everywhere on the screen.

The music is surreal and ambient in the best of ways, the challenges are actually challenging and not just complete BS like most games, and the learning value of this is extremely high. The devs clearly took their time with understanding what they were making and not just making something for a quick buck.","Quite a nice game! A good time killer, but I have a single complaint. Whenever an event happens that creates a pop-up on the screen, despite having auto pause on, any bubbles that appear under the event pop-up disappear shortly, and I feel like those extra points would help quite a bit, especially early on.","I love this game! I\'ve been playing Plague off and on since it first came out. I have so much fun challenging myself to get higher scores and tinkering around with different strategies! It\'s really interesting, also I love the cure version and the different scenarios! It\'s really awesome to be able to simulate these scenarios, they\'re so creative! I plan to pay for the full version soon. Way to go devs! Thanks for an awesome game.","I love the game It\'s a plague simulator game, with the option to play as doctors during the same plagues you play as. Ads aren\'t an issue as you have the options to get rid of them for a cheap price. And you have the ability to change the game through difficulty and genes, and it has a user friendly GUI. Overall a great and we\'ll balanced game for it\'s genre.","A very fun sim. I\'d have loved to continue playing it but unlocking things is just way too hard. If even a handful of people remain alive, even if they\'re infected it counts as a loss so your hours are wasted. You cannot unlock anything without getting somewhat lucky enough to have everyone die at the right time. Or you can pay to unlock things but if you\'re a free player it\'s beyond your reach. So only 3 stars for being only barely free to play and more pay to play in reality."],"appId":"com.miniclip.plagueinc","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.miniclip.plagueinc&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.ndemiccreations.rebelinc":{"title":"Rebel Inc.","description":"Can you stop the Insurgency?

I\'ve put a lot of time into this game. Really enjoy it, usually. The weekly challenges, however.... 3/7 times, the weekly challenges are broken. Like this week, the enemy is literally unbeatable without cheating. I can only make my guys so strong--there is a speed limit for players. Making an unbeatable map--that\'s easy. The goal should be difficult AND *achievable* (without cheating).","I think the game is very well put together and a good challenge. You have to balance your outreach to local communities, versus battling the insurgents, and corruption in the government you\'re trying to foster. Its also really important to read the description of some of the outreach upgrades because they may improve your other abilities so you benefit by purchasing them. Overall I\'ve had a great time with this game!","hidden charges and fee on top of fee is for phone bills not games. In two clicks you went from 5 to 1 stars. Love the game. Decided to buy premium. All that did was unlock a series of other purchases to play the rest of the game. Went from wow! That was a great deal too... Why am I being ripped off? Include an option for one price to unlock all aspects of the game. The whole \\"pay for this, pay for that, pay, pay and pay again\\" literally made me feel scammed.","Had fun at first, then the problems arise. During the first level, things make sense. You can cut off the insurgents, prevent them from running rampant, and manage your reputation. Then the next level. All of a sudden, insurgents are super soldiers. Your tactics don\'t work, reinforcing your troops doesn\'t do enough to overpower them, and even when you pull out all the stops, they just start randomly popping up behind your lines. It\'s like herding puppies but more annoying. Oh and paid upgrades!","Ok, this is a hard one. The game is so difficult even after buying the best advisers and premium (20 ish dollars), playing on easy, and watching a tutorial I can\'t beat the 3ed level. I might just be bad but it\'s so difficult! The insurgents have to be completely cornered and it\'s so hard to get rid of them. If I want to enjoy this game I can only play the first two levels, the first one is like medium and the second one is very difficult, the third one is just awful.

This is not a money hungry developer trying to milk every cent he can, there is a single, optional AD at the end of each level, and you are rewarded for dealing with it with extra gold. Gameplay is good, controls take some getting used to, i use the 2nd joystick, rpg elements are a little lacking, and could be improved, the story could use some work. Overall, great game, worth the download, and kudos to the dev for taking the time to do this. 10/10","Beautiful and detailed backgrounds and character look (although no character customization available)! Very decent combat mechanics and skill combos. Too bad the Dev doesn\'t have more time to spend on this game, it could be really amazing. While fun as it is, it\'s very short and very simple: no real RPG elements, nothing really to explore or solve, no side quests, and a decent but very linear and short story line that drives each mission. Great ad video placement/player\'s opt in choice to watch!","I LOVE the nostalgia aspect of it. it\'s a call back to the old days of dungeon crawling!! sorely needed in this day and age of over the top advertisement. this is a sleeper. dangerously subdued, but if you like the old style of dungeon crawling, this is the one for you. in game ads are minimal. what\'s more, it\'s one person doing all of it. definitely check this out. I love it.","I think this game is really good, especially being developed single-handedly,( just like the MoonShades game on Google). I would like to eventually see more interaction with objects in the dungeon. For instance, the static crates and such, maybe a few random gold pieces in a few here and there to give those objects more purpose then that. Otherwise everything is pretty solid quests, quest rewards ( whichseem to be tailored to be class defined...thankfully),graphics, story, simplicity in gaming.","Pretty decent simple rpg. Classes could be a little more advanced and no wizard yet but overall it\'s satisfying if you like simple hack and slash. Weapon skills tree could be more unique. Seems like they are all the same nowadays. It\'s always learn a skill, then increase it up or maybe you want another one but it\'s always a slow process and kinda stupid. Something more unique and interesting would be nice. Maybe harder to achieve skills but more rewarding."],"appId":"grid.crawler.free.offline.rpg.games.dungeon.ward","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=grid.crawler.free.offline.rpg.games.dungeon.ward&hl=en&gl=us"},"uk.fiveaces.nsfc":{"title":"New Star Manager","description":"*** The #1 game in AppSpy.com\'s Top 10 of 2018! ***\\n\\nWelcome to New Star Manager: The critically acclaimed game from Simon Read, creator of the BAFTA Award-winning New Star Soccer series.\\n\\nTake control of New Star FC \u2013 a beleaguered soccer club which needs your management skills and instincts to unlock the team\'s potential and make it to the top of the game.\\n\\n   \u201cIf you love football\u2026you\u2019d be mad not to download it\u201d The\xa0Guardian\\n\\nThis is soccer management like you\'ve never experienced it - Be more than just a player, be the head, the heart, and backbone of New Star FC.

There are numerous moments in-game where your assistant manager pitches in with advice which can help. The complexity does impede on gameplay too much for me but worth a try if you\'re a fan of this type of management in your football games. After giving it a go am sticking with NSS as there is just way too much to deal with here.","I never leave in actual worded review on anything but I have been playing this game for quite a while now and it\'s amazing. To anyone saying you need to buy cards to keep up, I just beat Champ league brentford while still in league2 with a 35 avg team. It\'s not easy by any means, but its possible. Like any team game, just know who your Strikers are, make sure every player gets at least some playing time, and pick and choose who gets training and when. Great game overall!","The game is extremely fun. The amount of stuff you have to take into account can be overwhelming, but it\'s a good challenge. The game play is good as well. Dribbling is kind of awkward because you have to pull back but then it\'s hard to stop and pass without going into shooting mode and hitting cancel. Progress through the bottom league is good, but the moment you get promoted your toast. You have to buy players because you\'ll barely get any scoring attempts in the second leave with you mid 30/low 40 players. You loss and everyone will be unhappy. I\'d be willing to buy a pack, but the 1, 2, or 3 players you\'d get for $10 will not make a difference with the rest of your squad being so low and not having any depth.","Good game, ruined by need to buy cards. Been playing nss for years and played this one now and then. The gameplay itself is great and hard to put down when you get into it. However, I am sick of losing by 1 goal no matter how many I get and all concern bars filling up, leading to poor play and losing key players after a few seasons. The entire experience and team frustratingly falls apart after a few good days play and is basically a waste of time.","Honestly great game but it still has its flaws. One is that you can\'t bend the ball nearly as well as you could in new star soccer. This makes it nearly impossible to hit free kicks and honestly this causes free kicks to put you in a worse situation. It piles defenders into the box and with no way to shoot you have to pass and hope you can get a scoring opportunity with 7 defenders in the box. But besides this and having to tank the second season because you aren\'t anywhere near good enough to be where you get promoted to this game is great."],"appId":"uk.fiveaces.nsfc","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.fiveaces.nsfc&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.pixelbite.xwt":{"title":"Xenowerk Tactics","description":"Play the first part for free.

I\'d love to be able to edit the squad formation or at least make em closer or further apart. Runs smoothly n looks great I wish I could zoom in a greater amount to enjoy it more. An the invisible enemy stages in the beginning are brutal without the cage shield n other abilities. It\'s been challenging, I like the world map and its random events.","Overall good game! Devs would you look into the pathfinding? Sometimes when I DoubleClick a spot one of my ops will get stuck somewhere... Also different environments in the woods when we have to engage and kill monsters... I don\'t like the auto-shooting... Maybe you guys could have an option to turn it on/off?? Game looks really good! No lag or crashes ... I have my game settings on high and it\'s doing amazingly! \ud83d\ude0a one more thing, could you add a normal mode? Only easy & hard available atm...","Games actually disappointing. I got interested in this game due to another game they produced, Space Marshals 2. That, absolutely love so let\'s see what else they got. The mix of old school 80s animation and computer graphics, does NOT work here. Plus random events via cards, it should simply happen and not be a card draw situation. A better way to have a functional tutorial and yet be a \\"make sense,\\" in game flow: have people in the team do backstory missions. You see their abilities.","Enjoying and engaging gameplay. You gear and deploy a 3 man squad (maybe more later in game?) The squad members gain random useful traits/mutations as they level up. Many of these are very cool to use. In a more expensive game I would ask for more classes and maybe branching weapon selections for the squad to add more strategy but as it is, its a great experience for the price. I also am a fan of using the cards to showcase most of the information as they do most of the time here.","I paid for it after the demo period thinking there would be more substance, but there isn\'t. I find that there are too few enemies and too few abilities to really change things. It has a gameplay loop similar to XCOM with combat being more fast-paced. Easy was a bit of a mindless slog. Turned it up to Hard (there is no Normal), and the randomized abilities cause a lot of early game forced losses as it becomes too easy to be overwhelmed and you don\'t have any abilities to do anything about it."],"appId":"com.pixelbite.xwt","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pixelbite.xwt&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.pixelbite.mutant":{"title":"Xenowerk","description":"Be the last hope against the mutant infestation.

It has micro-transactions (which I despise) but they were done correctly and not at all a nuisance. The gameplay loop is a solid, pick up and play for a few minutes one. The only reason I give it 4 stars is that all the levels are essentially visually the same. They\'re detailed and look good though, so it\'s only a minor complaint, frankly.","It\'s a great game, well it has potential to be great, 1. Missions need to be more hands, longer, and have better adjectives. 2. You should be able to buy (or earn) teammates to aid you. 3. It\'s currently boring how easy the enemies are to kill plus there\'s not many of them. 4. Just add some stuff like sas 3 did, well good luck with the game and keep at it.","Pretty awesome. A twin stick shooter with equipment upgrades. It works out of the box with my USB-C controller, and I couldn\'t be happier. It feels like a proper top-down action RPG, bit you can literally pick it up and clear a level with only five minutes to spare. Easy to pick up, have a minute of fun, and quit. Haven\'t even seen a single ad. This is not your usual Android store garbage.","The first time a free game wasn\'t shooting ads in my face every 10 seconds. Gameplay is reminiscent of Alien Swarm. It doesn\'t hold your hand, you might actually have to use your brain to pathfind through a level. The difficulty is fair, all around, looks like the kind of game that\'s worth someone\'s time. Makes me want to actually support the dev.","I enjoy this game. Graphics, game play, items/weapons leveling by experience gained from defeated aliens all well done. Only area I would immediately improve is what I can see while I\'m playing. For example, the camera is close down to the level, which I like especially the destructible environment and details like writing on walls, desks, etc. However, sometimes when moving backwards away from the enemies, shooting at them, they\'ll be off the screen, can\'t see what I\'m aiming at."],"appId":"com.pixelbite.mutant","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pixelbite.mutant&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.noxgames.hex.civ.strategy":{"title":"Hex Polis: Civ Outlanders 4x","description":"Hex Polis is stylizated turn-based strategy game.

Reminds me of the original Warcraft game style and energy.Great pace of play as well as a balance in upgrading. Please keep up the great work. Any chance of a one time remove all ads option?","I enjoy this game quite a lot, but I have a few critisisms. Unit previews don\'t show how far a unit can see. A unit with 2 sight nullifies the effects of watchtowers. A unit\'s standing animation usually slants to the side, making telling what tiles you can backstab from a bit awkward, if not worse because you can\'t take back movement options you select, meaning you can\'t try a side without commiting to it. Those are my gripes with the game.","Do not get this game. You play through levels so short there\'s barely any point to playing them. Its a naked money grabbing rip off of polytopia. The facing system really sucks, your guys spawn with their back facing the enemy so you get back stabbed straight up. So many things to pay for, its just awful. Don\'t waste your time.","This is a grueling obvious rip off of polytopia accept worse atlease it takes a few minutes to go through a round of polytopia in this I can barely get a few upgrades before my beginner unit bodies the enemy I think a larger scale map would be a huge improvement and tiles that slow but don\'t block units similar to what a game called unciv does"],"appId":"com.noxgames.hex.civ.strategy","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.noxgames.hex.civ.strategy&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.noxgames.mage.hero":{"title":"Mage Legends: Wizard Archer","description":"Roguelike super wizard RPG - Become magical archero and slay monsters in multiple dungeon battles.

There are ads for everything, and eventually the ads cause the app to close itself. Also, your pack prices are ridiculously high and they\'re not even good. No one will be paying $99.99, $199.99, or $399.99 to begin with, but you seriously think the reward of one item and handful of gems will entice anyone? Pure greed. Also, you have to grind so hard to get such little amounts of gold. I have so many scrolls I can\'t use to level my gear because of the tiny reward.","I can\'t wait for the city. I have to say this is a lackluster attempt in the shooter genre. It can\'t even get what it has copied, what every game in this genre slavishly copies, right. There is no progress counter so if you are taken out of the game you must start the chapter completely over. Some rooms repeat, some bosses repeat, even the hint of the day never changes reminding you to stop to shoot. I wanted to experience the unique city bent but I can no longer stand the game enough to do so.","04/30; fixed! 4/29: thank you! Updated 04/28 to say there\'s been 2 updates (at least) since my review and the Desert stage is still broken. Shielded enemies in level 46 don\'t register so you can\'t attack them and now they can\'t attack you, meaning you have to quit and waste what you earned. Fun, but stage 3, level 41-42 is bugged and you can\'t kill the enemies in it, stopping progress. Would like to give it a shot, but needs more equipment and the levels fixed","Better than Archero because equipment allows you to choose what abilities or skills you want to have. However, progress is painfully slow and equipment too hard to come by. The forge is pretty crappy. It only makes stuff I already have our don\'t need. Should be able to choose to try making a weapon or ring at the very least. Keep improving! Lots of promise.","I have been playing a lot of rogue-like shooting lately, and this game has more ad then the other simulator games like this one. I know you\'re trying to make money , but who wants to play a game that every powerups or free gears and have to wait 30 minutes to it. I know the simulator game doesn\'t add more ads then this game. Like the graphics,games play with different lvl powerups, and stage. I don\'t know the game save or if there is a way to save your game. Anyway that\'s my opinion when I play."],"appId":"com.noxgames.mage.hero","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.noxgames.mage.hero&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.gonzossm.sttt":{"title":"Su\u0440er Toss The Turtle","description":"BLAST.CO shop is back in business, and the competition has just risen to a whole new level!

Amazing visuals, easy goals to strive for, small micro transaction that you really don\'t need to help you progress in any way , no constant adds and if there is a add they reward you for watching with in-game currency to unlock more characters. It might be simple minded distance game but it\'s perfect and more mobile developers need to take notes","I love this! The upgraded weapon criteria. The animation redraws that feel just as charmingly nostalgic as the original. The only request I have is to add the option for the original song from the flash game to be an option to turn on. Like a Music Selection Button. The original song made me feel more like a space adventurer and I loved it. For old times sake, Gonzo. Please? Best wishes on every aspect of life, Kyra. (Agent K)","Very fun, has a huge number of creative unlockable characters besides the turtle, everything from a dolphin, a cat, a watermelon, and even a saiyan-like \\"fruitian\\". There are also good power-ups like the UI inspired super instinct. It has ads but they are built into the game in a way that doesn\'t ruin the experience.","You only watch the ads if you want to it\'s not forced. It only gets you skins for the character you play. This used to be an old flash game back in the day so it has nostalgia for me. Same thing and repetitive just make it a little further every time and get up grades not much skill needed but for a free game this has a lot going for it unlike others.","The game is addictive, the gore may not be for everyone but I think it\'s the best part! I keep shattering my highscores when I least expect it and thankfully it\'s not just another pay to win game, and once it starts to pick up you really make some cash and get the next best upgrade. A great way to pass the time, can\'t get the ad for 20 shells to work for some reason but I guess that\'s the best part, there\'s like no ads whatsoever!"],"appId":"com.gonzossm.sttt","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gonzossm.sttt&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.pixio.google.mtd":{"title":"Summoner\'s Greed: Idle TD Hero","description":"You, the greatest and most powerful summoner, broke into the King\u2019s castle and stole his priceless royal treasure!

But after seeing the funny meme-y ads, I gave this game a shot. So far, it\'s been really fun. Everything about this game just seems like smart mobile game design. Instead of playing ads after each wave or whatever, it gives you the choice to get rewards by watching ads. After losing a wave, you can either replay it or start over but you keep your summons\' levels and can relocate them. Kudos to the developer. I\'m impressed.","Pretty fun so far! Edit: with probably more than 20 hours into this game, I have nothing but good things to say. It\'s a fun \\"tower defense\\" game, with ample rewards through your progress. The game can get tough, but you\'re allowed to try again or back up some rounds. The ads are always optional, but do tend to be short and with a nice reward, so I rarely turn one down. 5 \u2b50 / 5 \u2b50 Great Game! Edit: I spent many hours on this game, and now I\'m back. I\'m hoping I\'ll get Monitor\'s rewards!","It\'s a fun game when you have the time to spare, I\'ve always loved tower defense\'s. The cute simple art style is great, in the future once I\'ve played more I hope to see creatures with just a (little) more design details but not a complaint. It\'s fun, thanks for making the ads for the game funny and honest, it did the trick. Lol","First of all, The ads for this game are adorable and finally broke me into downloading and playing it. So it\'s an adorable little tower defense that lets you build up over the course of several playthroughs of the waves. Lose on wave 10, start over and move your units that you summon around. Or you can try again with a buff and see if that\'s enough to push through. I\'m enjoying it :)","I decided to give this a try because the ads for it were pretty funny. All in all, it\'s a nice little tower defense game, but that\'s really about it. I think it would be better if wave progression continued even when you don\'t have the game open, and it notified you when you hit a wall, so to speak. Also, evolution items seem to be cash-only. Never a good idea. Maybe they\'re offered once you clear a certain number of waves, but that goes back to the game not progressing unless you have it open"],"appId":"com.pixio.google.mtd","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pixio.google.mtd&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.Wind.wings.Space.Shooter":{"title":"WindWings: Space Shooter","description":"\u25b6 FANTASY STORY\\n       The game is developed based on a fantasy story about a soldier who accidentally went through a time gap to the future.

A simple space shooter with easy controls and great colors and graphics. Pretty easy to upgrade because coins, rewards and such are in abundance. I love the slow down option because in games like this you just can\'t get outta the way sometimes. It\'s a game you\'ll wanna play all the way through barring any unknown surprise you gotta pay to win. But right now I like it. 5 stars.","Easy to pick up and put down. Paying the $20 for the premium version is well worth it. There are only one reason for not giving this game 5 stars, and that is the Fusion system. In the game, you get item upgrades for your ships, but it is controlled by a random generator, in addition to the ratios being poorly skewed. It makes going for (and therefore, investing in) fusing items relatively pointless. With the exception of that setup, this game is easily one of best time-killers I have played.","Excellent! Graphics are good, the game is fun. Gets tougher as you go, but not so quickly that I just get frustrated because it\'s \\"impossible\\" to win. I might have to restart several times, but not so often that I just quit playing. Actually, it\'s addictive once you start. The one negative is: programmers need to give SOME instruction on upgrading the ships, having multiple ships in play, the drones, and other equipment available for use. I\'ve had to trial and error figure out these things.","Recent update introduced incessant pop up ads that cannot be skipped. The dev response makes no sense. The use of a free game is a deal between the developer and the user. The user watches some ads in exchange for some value: either just the gameplay itself or an in-game item. If you change the amount of ads the user must watch to access the same value in the game, you changed the deal for the worse. I don\'t object to seeing ads. I object to being bombarded with them with no added value.","Best arcade space shooter. All the other\'s don\'t compare. Graphics are great. Game play is pretty fair it\'s good for beginners as well as experts. Multiple ways to upgrade the spaceships. They obviously took there time creating the game, instead of just throwing it together for some fast $$$. If you pay for the premium version you don\'t have to watch any ads. That might be the best part of the whole game.

The highest research tiers are a bit too expensive (mid-tier ones are fine). The free placement is nice, but a quick rotation button could help. Could use separate counts for settlers and visitors. Finally, depleted outposts should be dismantled, so the map doesn\'t fill with so many gray markers. The game is still new as of writing, so I hope to see improvements made. Overall, though, good and recommended.","This is an excellent and entertaining take on the original game, featuring many realistic scenarios, costs, and graphics. It truly breaks through the normalcy of city-building games and colonization. They have done a great job balancing both wait times and monetization; ads are completely optional, and for that I sincerely thank the developers. Suggestion-wise, I would love to see higher graphics, and perhaps an option to hide the repair alerts for the sake of visuals. Thank you!","Great game so far! The Mechanics work great and it\'s fun to play. However the frequency of critical events is in my opinion too high. I\'m on the game for 5 minutes during which my batteries broke down, and engineer dies, disgruntled settlers steal a rover? Of all things, makes playing quite difficult, and seems. A little excessive. The zoom settings are sometimes hard to deal with. It would be nice if there was a slider option instead of 2 fixed zoom settings. Hope this helps. Keep it up!","Reduce stars 3 to 2... I\'m stuck! I\'ve finished the tutorial, have 80GP and now I\'m stuck because it is telling me to build a command center.. I already have one! I can\'t move past it. I\'ve tried to click the \\"Settings\\" wheel several times, but it\'s greyed out. All that needs to happen to for the \\"Settings\\" button to be enabled throughout the Tutorial. That way if someone wants to restart, they can.","This game is great, but it does have a few flaws that could be fixed. For example, the whole tutorial was pretty good but if you didn\'t finish it in one go, it would glitch. This would ultimately make it nigh impossible to complete said tutorial, and would require you too Uninstall to reinstall to fix this problem. After you do the tutorial, it is a great game. I love the dynamic of the game and it is not to hard to understand."],"appId":"com.alexanderwinn.landfall","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.alexanderwinn.landfall&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.armorgames.voidtyrant":{"title":"Void Tyrant","description":"Build a deck as you battle across the galaxy, gathering powerful cards along the way.

I see what they were going for but at the end of the day it feels terrible to lose because of horrible luck. There is some strategy involved in the ability cards, but most of the time they\'re REQUIRED to win battles and not optional play styles. You could be totally min maxed with your cards and items and still get stomped by a tiny little slime because your luck is bad. Makes it hard to enjoy.","Found a bug. Repeated tree times. Went for a fourth and discovered there is a variable. I duplicated a card. Second use was free. Then after the round I got both of the cards back in my hand. It completely messed up the interface ui. After it happened the cards were stacking on top of each other in my hand. I got a few screen shots. I used all the cards in my hand and it reset the interface. So I did it again. After the second one I killed my self and went to scene 2-1 and did it again","This game has really good combat mechanics between the gauge and the way you can alter it. There are also insane combos and cards(power surge) that feel overpowered but make sense when you need to work for them. The only problem is that often times when you lose a few rounds then you rely on the deck and RNG seems to always favor the AI if I can\'t alter it.","I think the game is very fun and very well made. It\'s simplistic enough to understand quickly but complex enough for strategists. I\'ll admit, I get very frustrated sometimes because I never seem to make it past the second worlds. But that might just be me. It\'s a game that rewards you for learning the mechanics and upgrading. It\'s so satisfying to easily beat an enemy which used to be a problem. I feel like you rely more on confidence than upgrades.","Honestly one of the few phone apps that I feel ok with spending money on. It was like $5 to get all the \\"spirits\\" and you just get to keep them and use them over and over. It has replayability with the different classes and the continued dungeon mode, and each time you beat it something changes mechanically. Honestly one of the best games I have found in awhile.

But after I spent a few hours and almost all of my red gems trying to unlock there 4th hero, I just can\'t do it. If it\'s RNG to draw the cards, then it needs improvement. If you can\'t actually unlock willow through the battles, then that needs to be explained somewhere. All of the others so far were unlockable that way.","This game is very entertaining and very easy to get into. It\'s a easy to play hard to master type of auto battle game but its simple in its approach which is great for new players. It\'s character diversity, body diversity it really has it all besides the music and sound effects could do a little better. But the main reason for the low review is the Massive pay to win here. You will get destroyed by any wallet warrior its really a shame because this game is great.","Initially the game seems to be pretty good. I enjoy TDs & this one is a new spin for me. However, I was having issues with my phone & had to uninstall & reinstall some apps, this being one...I can\'t back out of the tutorial to even find out if I lost all my progress or not (nor adjust volume in game settings), I\'m hoping it backed up...but it seems that I\'ll have to complete the tutorial again \ud83d\ude12 before I\'ll know if I\'m given an option load previous data. Really needs skip tutorial option.","5* -> 2* Originally this game was awesome. But I had to lower my rating for 1 major game breaking reason. During the matches the pairing isn\'t a queue or round robin. It\'s fully random. I\'ve had games where every other fight I went back to the same person. Sometimes someone just has a way higher rating and will beat you, but if you played everyone else you could still get 2nd. But instead you could end up playing that person 3 times and never play every other player resulting in a loss."],"appId":"com.hyperdotstudios.mythiclegends","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hyperdotstudios.mythiclegends&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.lemonjamstudio.infiniteknights":{"title":"Infinite Knights - Idle RPG","description":"The good King had died, and no one could decide.\\nWho was rightful heir to the Throne.\\nIt seemed that the land would be torn by devils,\\nOr saved by a miracle alone \u2014\\nAnd that miracle appeared in the countryside of the the kingdom:\\nThe Sword in the Stone.\\nThe one who pull the sword, will become the king and lead the knights to defeat devils.\\n\\nAre you the one, who can pull up the sword?\\n\\n\u25a0 Addictive Turn-based RPG \\nGet to Floor 2000 and defeat the Devil King\\n\\n\u25a0 Automatically Offline Income! \\nYou can upgrade the village, get incomes while you are offline.\\n\\n\u25a0 Infinite Heroes\\nAll heroes are randomly generated.

Concepts can be fun but daily rewards are just options to watch more ads. Almost every action brings new adds. Sometimes it displays the button as an ad other times it says claim but is an ad. There is no option to go completely ad free. Just every time you purchase gems you get a few ad free tokens, this is also on top of a monthly subscription that doesn\'t prevent ads. Based on the first 20 minutes of gameplay i had 10 adds, so I\'d say there is an average of 20 per day.","Its a fun game for the most part, alot of ads if you want to do stuff, but hey they have to make money too....only issue is that i think its a dead game, no discord, and no directions on what things do... .like the alter of new heros, has quest to unlock new heros, but after you complete the quest it lets you \\"level up the class\\" but as far as i can tell it does nothing","Great, simple fun, combining standard turn based rpg and idle gaming. Only drawback is you can\'t manage their equipment, there\'s auto-equip, then that\'s it, what they grab is what they have, seemingly forever. Making it virtually impossible to keep the same characters competitive over time as their equipment will simply get outdated and you can\'t upgrade it. Just to make it worse, the auto equip will make some wonky choices.","Love the gameplay. Easy to pickup and learn how combat works. The characters look great and I love how they have different appearances. It might just be a issue with my game, but any time I attempt to load a ad, the game freezes then crashes. The sound is missing from gameplay as well. Overall, a great game but a issue lowers my rating.","So it\'s a good game, but there are some glaring errors: 1) Please change the \\"can\'t fetch ads\\" pop-up! If I\'m connected to the internet and YOU can\'t fetch ads, that\'s your problem not mine so don\'t ask for payment because you failed. 2) Increasing the star-level of items you make should always be done with gold (maybe with a video option if you can\'t afford the gold)! Watching an ad should be a choice, not mandatory. This is compounded by error 1 too!"],"appId":"com.lemonjamstudio.infiniteknights","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lemonjamstudio.infiniteknights&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.yodo1.rodeo.safari":{"title":"Rodeo Stampede: Sky Zoo Safari","description":"Saddle up and get ready to wrassle with the stampede-iest critters this side of the Savannah.

I don\'t think you should have to put your device into airplane mode just to avoid the amount of ads that get dumped on you. It\'s VERY annoying. After just about every time you die there\'s an ad waiting for you. While I realize ads mean money and as a company money needs to be made, there are ads to double coins, revive, etc. Those are fine. You can purchase something from the shop to get rid of them, but I don\'t have money to drop","When i first installed this game it was super fun. All you have to do to get rid of the ads is turn of your wifi and mobile data but when my zoo started to get bigger and bigger it now has so many bugs to the point where I don\'t enjoy the game anymore. Every time I try to play the Jurassic park it always stays on the loading screen and i always have to restart it. I think if yodo1 would fix these bugs I would and everyone else would enjoy this game much more but that is why I give this 2 stars.","Game is fun most of the time but it\'s overrun with ads, after almost every loading screen there\'s an ad, if you ever play this game I recommend putting it in airplane mode to get rid of the ads. (Note for response: I understand that revenue is needed from ads but it shouldn\'t get to the point where it ruins the experience, I now fear messing up a run because that means I\'ve got to watch an ad afterwards, but I want to make it clear this is a good game)","I have contacted support for multiple big issues. It\'s been days without reply. Playing in the space zoo, once I finish the last of the 3 missions and the run is over,there is no \'done\' button just a blank screen and I have to exit and open the game again, completely losing the ability to upgrade any space zoo enclosure. So the game just acts like the missions never happened and I get 3 new missions but no enclosure upgrade. The game has gotten buggy and makes it hard to binge play like before.","I love this game I really do. I\'ve been pkaying it for a few years now, but it\'s gotten a bit buggier. Of course thats expected with the zoos getting larger, but my biggest problem right now is the ads. To retry you need to watch an ad, but you are unable to close the ad after its finished. So you restart the game, and have to rewatch the ad to play once again. Please fix this! I love the new ocean map but it sucks that I can barely play it."],"appId":"com.yodo1.rodeo.safari","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.yodo1.rodeo.safari&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.sparklingsociety.cityisland5":{"title":"City Island 5 - Building Sim","description":"Build a city, your city\\n\u201cCity Island 5 - Tycoon Building Simulation Offline\u201d, a new city builder game from Sparkling Society, will make you the mayor of small town starting on just one island.

The constant, incessant ads that randomly pop up, that are required for getting any rewards has almost made this game unplayable. The events are now just repetitive and trite. I don\'t see myself playing this game much longer. Enjoyable game to pass the time if you like these kind of sims. A little too easy to click the wrong button and spend coins or keys you\'re trying to save up, but otherwise no major issues.","Follow up from April. Date 8/23/22, Still crashing at random. Just did the update an was hoping it would help. It didn\'t which is disappointing. Still don\'t have the rare decorations. I do like the Catch the crook.. please help! 4/27/22. The game has crashed 6 times in the last 13 minutes. I keep writing reviews & writing to the developers but it is being deleted or removed. This is irritating !! An way too many pop up ads even for a \\"free\\" game. Especially one that you make purchases in","It\'s a really fun game but realistically it takes too long to get to certain levels. For example with the snow level it asked for Community buildings I\'m in level 16 but I have to wait to get to level 34 to get Community Builders realistically that\'s too long and I don\'t know if I\'ll be interested in keep doing it by then. It\'s too hard to earn the dollar gold coins and requires too many coins to achieve things.","Good features and and not so good. It is tough to make a game with the right reward to longevity ratio. This game makes a decent attempt. \ud83e\udd14 The Good -Nice graphics\ud83d\ude01 -Nice concept of multiple islands with different characteristics.\ud83d\ude42 The Bad -No help file (that I could find) to describe the meaning of things. \ud83e\udd14 -Does not automatically collect profits. Forces you to constantly touch screen, for me very annoying. \ud83e\udd28 -Cars driving around forces you to constantly tap screen. Again annoying. \ud83d\ude12","Been enjoying the game for about 3 hours over a day /half making steady progress. One might initially think it\'s a money grab but with a little patience and quest completion there\'s plenty of cash to be made for further advancement. I really appreciate the amount of buildings that can construct and/or upgrade simultaneously. I will have to research what a couple of the road options are for but for now I Think I found a game I\'ll put some spare time in to."],"appId":"com.sparklingsociety.cityisland5","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sparklingsociety.cityisland5&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.dvdfu.chicken2":{"title":"Chiki\'s Chase","description":"Chiki\'s Chase is a high-speed, tricky action platformer.

It\'s cute, pretty, fun, challenging but not too frustrating, and there are no ads! I recommend you buy the full game to support the dev if you can though. The pixel graphics are crisp and colorful, and the sounds and haptics really add to the feel of the game. I like how the shopkeeper dialogue changes with the context. I do wish getting hurt didn\'t make you lose all your stars, and there was an option to flip jumping and attacking.","I love the game, it\'s art and everything about it. It is amazing, I at first thought it would be like most over runner games but I was pleasantly surprised that there were no ads. At all, just a something telling you to buy the ability to collect gems at the end of run, as well as no other in app purchases. Just a single easy one time payment that you don\'t even need to purchase for the full game.","Outstanding side-scrolling game that harkens back to original Mario games. (There is even an element of super mario RPG here.) Gameplay is simple and fun with room for upgrades and ever-changing levels. I wish there was a better \\"checkpoint\\" system as starting all over at the beginning can get mundane. Well done for this programmer\'s first game! I bought the full version as it is worth it.","I would like to preface this by saying I am not one who is easily pleased. But I must say, this game is INCREDIBLE. The soundtrack, the concept, everything. This is one of few games that can always be enjoyed in its original format. There\'s so much to love about Chiki - the character balancing, the simple yet high-ceiling movement capabilites, the sheer number of upgrade combos/strats possible... I could go on and on. And it\'s not super time demanding! Instant classic, 100% worth the download \ud83d\udc4f","I absolutely adore this game. I love all of the small details, this truly is one of the best mobile games I have downloaded in a long time! A few of my favorite things: - EVERYTHING HAS A SOUND!!! You can tell what\'s coming just by the sound it makes! - I LOVE how the lasers add a bass track to the background music! A few suggestions: - It would be really cool if different objects also added tracks, like the lasers. - More statements from the store clerks, maybe? A bit more variety."],"appId":"com.dvdfu.chicken2","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dvdfu.chicken2&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.fluffyfairygames.idleminertycoon":{"title":"Idle Miner Tycoon: Gold & Cash","description":"Are you a true gold miner?

Write us an email: community@idleminertycoon.com","comments":["Unlike a lot of mobile games I\'ve been playing, this game is both not unfinished and there are no forced ads. You\'re going to watch them though to make any progress whatsoever because you\'re darn sure the prices they charge for their silly little digital items, which let me remind you are not real, is absurd. Could easily spend hundreds of USD and have little to show for it. Also $15 USD ad remover. The option to spend money litters the screen at all times. Wallets beware.","The game is great, and I only have one problem so far... the ads! I know, I know, people say that about so many games & the developers need their money, but I have to put my phone on airplane mode to play. Often times the ads are optional, but you also get random ads. I don\'t like to spend my money on games, so I\'m not going to get the \\"no ads\\" pass thing, so it\'s kind of is my fault that there are ads, but it just ruins the experience when I get a random ad.","I got this game to get diamonds on My Dear Cat thinking I would completely hate it, planning to delete after I get my reward, but I actually enjoyed it. It\'s only 4/5 stars because of the ads. Thats about my only complaint, but y\'all do need to fix that for sure. It would be a much better game. Also the prices for no ads, that isn\'t as much as an issue though as the amount of ads.","It\'s a really fun game and I love the mining and different mines and explorations it is a really nice touch that there are different ones. There are really great offers in the games and the game treats you well! The only tiny problem I have is that it sometimes stops but that\'s just because everything is running at the same time. I really do enjoy this game! :)","I\'ve only played the game about 30 minutes total (in my spare time) in 2 days. The more tunnels you have, the more money you make in the game. I haven\'t tried cashing out yet because I doubt I have enough points for anything. The game keeps you fairly active with the boosters for the tunnels which makes time fly. I enjoy it, just give it a try!"],"appId":"com.fluffyfairygames.idleminertycoon","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fluffyfairygames.idleminertycoon&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.prineside.tdi2":{"title":"Infinitode 2 - Infinite Tower Defense","description":"Every game in this Tower Defense strategy game (TD) is endless - stand against infinite number of enemy waves for as long as you can!\\n\\nComplete the story line for great rewards.\\n\\n- Simplistic, well optimized, tiny in size but overfilled with features: 14 different types of towers, 11 types of enemies, bosses, miners, teleports, barriers, modifiers, resources...\\n- Over 40 different levels with leader boards and plenty of quests - no endless grind!\\n- Towers gain experience, abilities, different aiming strategies and can be heavily upgraded\\n- Miners can be used to dig out Resources for new global upgrades\\n- Map editor can be used to build any map with resources won for each game.\\n- Music tracks are stored in maps and played with synthesizer!

I think that the interesting mechanics of bosses and the balanced enemies really makes you use your brain more, instead of mindlessly placing one tower. Plus, i just think that ADVINAS and the story line is just great. i cant wait to see what the future has to offer for this game.","Played this on steam, and loaded my data onto my phone to keep playing. Very fun game! Completely free, at least so far. You can spend money, but it\'s not really required in any way, it\'s more just there so you can support the devs if you choose to. Lots of maps, lots of towers, lots of enemies, really its a bang up job all around! Highly recommended!","Surprisingly deep for just a tower defense game. Having to spend the same single run currency on resource gathering as well as towers to progress makes you think a little more and have to prioritize one over the other. That, along with the insane size of the skill tree leaves a lot to do in the game. Be warned that the game is heavily ad driven when it comes to getting bonuses and such","Very fun tower defense game, with more technical appeal and strategy than superficial graphics-focused games of its genre. If you prefer depth over showy effects, you will love this game. Also, the ads are only for receiving free rewards (which are quite decent), not random popups or requirements to progress from one screen to the next! The developers actually want their players to enjoy the game, not mindlessly click through ads!","Just started playing this afternoon. I\'m hooked, there is so much content to work towards it blows my mind, this would sell great if it had a price tag. The start was a little overwhelming but it\'s a lot easier to figure out the menus and such after the tutorial. Very well designed tower defense game! Looking forward to more content from this development team!!

","comments":["Originally thought this to be a clickbait game but the gameplay is exactly as advertised. It\'s a good way to pass the time and definitely can be addicting. It would be cool if there was an option to make it more challenging. I paid for the ad free version years ago and the app remembered it when I re-downloaded it now. It can be played offline but to really get some of the cool stuff, you\'ll have to watch ads. Overall I\'d say 4.5\u2b50\ufe0f","LOVE the game. I would have rated 5 stars, however, I am on Level 1,572 and the levels are so repetivitive. Also, what is killing me is that I have been on the same level for 3 weeks now because the game keeps crashing. I love the game, and don\'t even mind the ads, so I have been patiently waiting for this issue to be resolved, but I\'m about to just delete it. I used to play off and on every day. Now I may TRY to play once every few days but still crashes4 seconds in... PLEASE fix this.","Overall a good game. It can get a little bit of challenging with some of the later levels. It does contain ads about every other two runs. Sometimes free stuff would come but it would be in and cost of an ad. There was a moment where I said no thanks to watching an ad, but it still played an ad. I am not much of an ad person. But overall, a fun game to get into.","Cool concept and fun to play for the first 30 minutes or so. Annoying to have to wait to get the gun shop and find nothing of use over and over again. I stuck it out and finally bought the $10,000 machine gun only to find that the $1,000 one that I bought near the beginning was way better. Very repetitive with no payoff after about the first 25 levels. It\'s literally the same thing over and over with new outfits. The guns don\'t get any better and every level is super easy.","Enjoyed the first thirty or so levels. Seemed like a decent idea, short obstacles with bullet time. Paid the $2.99 to remove ads because of how many ads there were and I had been enjoying the game. After about an hour I noticed most of the levels were recycled. The difficulty does not go up and there are maybe 40 different layouts of levels. Lack of variety make this game boring. $2.99 isnt bad for like an hour of entertainment. But thats all this game is worth.

It\'s simple to learn, but compelling. Great, art. And for awhile, it actually was fun. But... The ad model is awful. An 30 second ad every time you die if you want to continue your progress. But the game play is what really cuts it for me. Game physics change randomly so what worked before might not work the next time. Lighting changes to where you can\'t see your player. Quests that depend on unreachable goals. Ruins the game","O: There is a loud, obnoxious ad after nearly each round. Also, opting to watch an ad to revive Alto will close the game, causing it to restart the round instead of picking up where he landed. It is very irritating. I downloaded the app yesterday. I have only played a couple times, and it seems like fun. The effects of the ads are annoying, though. UD: Paid to remove ads. Now it glitches, moving the character in a way that causes crashes. Glitches also shake the scene causing round loss.","Sort of fun, controls are simple, and not much explanation is given. Would be a soft 5 stars BUT when I choose not to watch a 30-second unskipable ad to revive, I\'m still hit with watching a 30-second unskipable ad just to start over. Not a huge issue except I keep getting long flat sections (can\'t do tricks) followed by chasms that require a lot of speed to cross (you see why the ad issue is frustrating now, right?). Uninstalling, may try again in a year.","It\'s a very relaxing game, just as the last one was. The soundtrack is very immersive if you put in earbuds, like the sound of sledding on the sand and the grinding on the vines and the music is wonderful and pleasant even after an hours worth of play, the storm and waterfalls are just amazing. And not to mention the detailed landscapes\u2764\ufe0f The only slight problem is that it\'s more sensitive than the last game and the ads are a bit more frequent.","It\'s fun and zen and easy to lose hours to. The problem for me is the ads. The game\'s main draw is a sort of zen flow state, and these ads blasting in your ear completely take you out of it. Also, when you die, it\'ll offer you an ad to revive. If you turn down the ad, sometimes it\'ll play anyway and give you nothing. I don\'t know what the alternative is, since all things must be monetized, but it\'s yet another case where capitalism has robbed a game of the thing that makes it compelling."],"appId":"com.noodlecake.altosodyssey","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.noodlecake.altosodyssey&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.hyperbeard.odyssey":{"title":"Tsuki\'s Odyssey","description":"Tsuki\u2019s Odyssey is a passive adventure game that immerses you into the world of Tsuki and the oddball characters of Mushroom Village.\\n\\nDecorate your home, make friends, catch all kinds of fish and so much more!\\n\\nIt is important to note that Tsuki is not your pet, but a free spirit who will move and interact with the world as they please.

I love this game because you don\'t have to P2P anything if you don\'t want to. If you want to buy more items to decorate your treehouse, you can just fish and sell your catches to get carrots. I do wish there was an unlockable feature to expand the treehousewhen you reach milestone levels. It would be great to have more space to put all the furniture in.","Great concept, wonderful characters and personalities, beautiful music, the pieces of furniture and items and everything are all adorable! Each day I couldn\'t wait to talk to everyone and see what they will tell me next, every few hours I check in to what new items could be available in the shops, each fishing spot has their own unique fishes! There are a few very noticeable bugs and unsure as to where exactly to report them, such as dialogues, the entire lighthouse being NOT at the back, etc.","Cute and relaxing! It is pretty slow, especially once you get to level six, but the best part is, there are no ads unless you choose to watch them! The weekly comic on the town hall message board is probably the best part of the game! The only thing that is frustrating is that I have been stuck for SEVERAL WEEKS because the only achievements I haven\'t got are the fishing ones, but the big fishing pole I need to buy to achieve this isn\'t popping up in the store... Losing interest.","I played the original Tsuki game and loved it. This is enough of a departure to be new but there are cumbersome aspects. Having to go to the map every time you want to visit a different area is time consuming vs the OG game. At least a quick option between house and carrot garden would make decorating between the two much easier. I also have no idea how to progress. That\'s nice to an extent, but I\'m not sure if I\'m supposed to be doing specific things or not. The music is lovely, tho, as always.","Great game!I love the fact that the option of watching an ad gives you 250 carrots (the in-game currency) and I also love the fact that you can design your house however you want it to and make lots of friends. I also like the pictures. Those are really cute! I never played the 1st,but the 2nd is Great! One thing you could add though, is maybe skills, like charisma or fishing!

Happy crushing!","comments":["This is THE Castles Crusher game from my childhood ! So simple yet challenging. The ads system seem broken, didn\'t have ads for most of the first game , but after that every few mission I would have a 15-30 sec were my screen was just freeze, as if the game was thinking it was showing me a ads(To be clear I didn\'t see any ads , just the screen freeze )","A solid repacking of the original trilogy with bonuses, but horrendously optimized; perhaps some memory leak. All games in the collection can occasionally have enormous, unplayable bursts of lag that persist until a restart. Pair this with occasional moments in the last game where fireballs and debris will just abruptly disappear during the action, and it\'s clear this needs more time in the oven; but the games are technically free elsewhere, so you\'re just paying for mobile accessibility.","I was excited when i found this. I shouldn\'t have been.. The ads appear after 20 levels, but then it\'s an ad after every - single - level. And don\'t think you\'ll get away by turning off your connection or blocking the apps internet access. The game still fades down for a good 10+ seconds while it desperately tries to load an ad for you, and you can\'t click anything during this time. The poor performance is another thing, once I got to the \\"second\\" game it was pretty much unplayable even on low.","Only played the original 2 so far and they\'re as good as they ever were. Great to have them available to play! But they are in desperate need of optimisation for mobile, I\'m getting constant frame drops and game speed ups/slow downs which make it particularly annoying to play at times. A UI pass and wide-screen update would be great too. As mentioned, the games are still great, they just need bringing up to modern standards.","As of right now (day 1 release day that is) the game performance especially the first two games is very poor, please improve performance. Aspect ratio is also very problematic, seems like it\'s only 4:3 while it should cover my entire screen(and during gameplay too) UI is okay, but not as easy to use as the android port of crush the castle Please fix these issues and it can easily go we over my initial 3 star rating"],"appId":"com.armorgames.ctclegacy","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.armorgames.ctclegacy&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.playsidestudios.idlearea51":{"title":"Idle Area 51","description":"The aliens have CRASH landed!!\\nSalvage as much alien tech as possible from the downed UFO and take it to your super secret desert facility for research in Idle Area 51.\\n\\nStart small and build your operation from scratch.

","comments":["Awesome little time burner. Issues at the last level with numeric values rolling over to near zero, you can\'t get enough money to finish the game. I recommend you get the add free option, it makes game play much easier and faster. Be careful with the reset player data, you lose any rubies over a certain amount. I\'m on my 4th reset and will continue to play. I wish they would add more levels after the air force base. Please add more alien antics!!","Progress in this game is BRUTALLY slow. Like.. Unbearable, unattainable, unrelenting, unpleasantly slow. For an \\"idle\\" game, you are required to return every 2 hours.. TWO HOURS. That is not an idle game. That\'s a money grabber. Everything is ad based. Upgrades are extremely expensive but you get almost nothing from your 2hr gains. Just is not worth it.","For starters, the creator of this game just wants money. Progressing slowly but fast enough to get to the next stage requires watching a high number of ads. The set amount of everything is too high, and because of this, it takes forever to get anywhere. Second, I\'m not buying a PS5 game, $100+ for a minimum amount of resources, it\'s insane. I\'m not here to pay your rent, so change some things up because this is just ridiculous. Third, you can\'t save your data, I wonder what that\'s about.","I really like this game but there are so many bugs out makes it hard to enjoy. My examples are that I like quiet games. In almost every game I play I have muted but after each ad it let\'s some sound slip through. I have to go into settings and turn on and off the sound again. Other than that I don\'t like how I get a notification I can\'t fix. Like the clipboard in the corner, is always on even when I don\'t have any missions completed. It\'s like that for most things and I find it annoying.","It is a cute game. A standard idle game and interesting. There is a bug where the 2x button is underneath the upgrade lab button and is not disabled when the lab pop up is visible. So when I am trying to upgrade the lab I repeatedly get a pop-up asking if I want to watch a video to double profit. A minor bug, but given that you have to tap 100s of times on the upgrade button it is enough to make me not want to play."],"appId":"com.playsidestudios.idlearea51","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.playsidestudios.idlearea51&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.erow.stickmanheroes":{"title":"One Gun: Stickman","description":"This game is the greatest RPG action game, is combination of fighting games and shooting games.

However it literally takes too long move in to the higher levels. You have to watch videos to get big amounts of coins and even then you beat like 1 or 2 levels before having to watch another like 10 videos just to maybe get to the next level. This game relies on watching ads to level up because without them it would take forever to get the amount of coin needed","I really like this game, but I remember a time when it was harder to get items, when there were no ads to watch to get coins, I just came back to this game and I\'m sad to see it become so easy. If I would recommend something, I would recommend to make it harder to get coins and rare items, maybe set a limit on the amount of ads someone can watch to get money, also add more weapons that cause knockback, it\'s super fun to win by never getting touched, I only think one weapon causes knockback.","I think its a gery good way to pass time and play for fun. I find it super fun because of all the different ways to upgrade like equipment and skills. One thing i find annoying is that super gun pop up. It looks like a bow. Its not the constant pop up that is annoying its that the pop up stops the music and interrupts my groove. If you could make it not interrupt my groove I would be appreciative. Thx great game.","Could be a fun game.. If it wasn\'t riddled with ads. Got to the minigun, only for it to just.. stop firing every few seconds. Im holding the attack button, nothing happens. Game now crashes VERY frequently, the menus are confusing as hell for new players, and the difficulty is so weirdly scaled with no hints as how to unlock certain abilities.","Would be five stars but after buying the 10 elite chests with the minigun at level 50 my game crashed(for the first time yet) and I lost all the items. There doesn\'t seem to be a restore purchases option either. Also, the \\"no ads\\" purchase with different characters doesn\'t cancel the rewards ads which is extremely frustrating considering how many it takes to unlock chests. The small boxes should be at most one ad to unlock. It makes the game nearly impossible to progress in"],"appId":"com.erow.stickmanheroes","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.erow.stickmanheroes&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.ketchapp.rider":{"title":"Rider","description":"Get ready for some flippin\' action!\\n\\n\\n\\nPerform insane stunts while you cruise through the never-ending world of Rider!

I really enjoy it. Good selection of bikes and a good thing to play when you have nothing to do. However, the random bike feature is not good at all, due to the fact that it chooses like 5 bikes and doesn\'t actually cycle through your entire garage. There are a few bugs as well and some obstacles that aren\'t possible, but still a fun game. Edit: I decided to add the fact that sometimes it flips you for no reason, and that can be frustrating. Also the music can be a bit repatative.","It was fun until it started flipping with my interaction. The game decides to flip on it\'s own, a lot of the platforms are set just far enough off that it will bounce you off course. I understand that it may need to limit your speed but just intentionally ruin the game? Why? \\"You\'ll get more cars cause they effect your game.\\" Which is true. The vehicle you drive can heavily affect your game.","I thought it was an amazing flawless game at first but I keep bouncing off of things that shouldn\'t be bounced on or going to fast and not being able to control the car while crashing into the next obstacle, and somthing when i use an ad it sends me back to the home screen? I know how hard it was to create this game but mabye there should be some sort of brake thing? Sometimes you shouldnt fix whats not broken and its a really good game other then the very small glitches!","Really fun, but sometimes I\'ll watch an ad to get revived and be sent back to the title screen anyway, or spawned off a cliff and die immediately. The game is far too inconsistent and glitchy to be considered great, physics don\'t work consistently and the random nature of the obstacles means sometimes you\'ll be going too fast to survive the next one, or too slow to make a jump, but you won\'t know until it\'s too late. Good way to kill time unless you have rage issues like I do.","I found it quite intertaining, there isn\'t to many adds either. The game has simple controls that are easy to learn aswell. I wish the transition from easy to hard was a little better though. There is a few glitches, like I can be on the ground and be holding down the button to move forward but randomly flip and die. Sometimes it\'s laggy near the start if not great internet. Over all, I suggest you play the game when your waiting or have a short amount of free time before your busy again."],"appId":"com.ketchapp.rider","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ketchapp.rider&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.maddog.shaqfu":{"title":"ShaqFu: A Legend Reborn","description":"The world lies on the brink of disaster.

The ads don\'t bother me, but there\'s not a lot to do besides wait then scroll up and down your floors and click on the doors/super zombies. Currency takes a while to accumulate and it does not gather offline, so really the experience of this game is leaving your phone running it and doing something else.","This game is not bad. But do the ads roll in. It is set up to make you want to watch ads for premium currency (only way to upgrade your bonuses). Then you get an ad almost everytime you open a chest, fight a zombie boss on a floor, or open a door to rescue someone. I would have stayed if it wasnt for the ads constantly popping up every time I played the game","It isnt worth it friends. There is no \\"no ad\\" package so even when you put money into it you still get ads. The game is super slow with very little replayability. It has no normal incremental growth. Instead it is very much a \\"pay to play\\" and \\"pay to advance\\". Sure you could go at it free but you\'ll be stuck there for weeks with little to no advancement.","This is a good game for when I\'m taking a breather from life. The one thing that bugs me is the ads, there\'s an ad after every 3 zombies, there\'s an ad when changing menus, there\'s even the occasional idle ad when I\'m not even doing anything. In short when I\'m playing seriously, I shouldn\'t have to see 7 ads in the span of a single minute","Fun and easy overall, but the jump of in game currency for upgrades is pretty high. You go from paying 100 coins to 100,000.and getting that doesn\'t come easy. But, an easy to get into game with pretty good potential. I\'d like to see more characters or specialists and maybe be able to place them on certain levels, and an easier way to grind in game currency or a more steady increase in price."],"appId":"com.spcomes.zombiehive","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.spcomes.zombiehive&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.foursakenmedia.blockfortressempires":{"title":"Block Fortress: Empires","description":"Welcome to the Blockverse - a mysterious and dangerous universe made out of cubes.

However, there are a few things that I think could be fixed. For example, in my opinion, this game is only playable if you turn the look sensitivity and attack look sensitivity all the way down, and play in first person. Most of the guns are extremely difficult to aim if not played with these specifications, which could possibly be fixed by making the crosshair bigger. Other than that, it is a mostly perfect game.","I would give more stars is i knew how exactly to change my defense station from the default. I spent a lot of time on the second defense systems and want to change over to that one instead of default. But i can\'t seem to figure it out as there is no options to do so from what i have seen so far. Could i het some assistance in this? The game is awesome so far besides this seemingly annoying glitch.","It is quite an interesting game, and although the melt guns are rather overpowered, this game is pretty good! I think previously my suggestion was a bit nonsensical, but I just recently cooked up an idea that would help most of the playerbase. If instead of just getting what you get with an upgrade, you can choose what and how much you to upgrade that, using a point spending system.","It\'s awesome! I do experience some glitches and bugs sometimes(such as the holo turret, when set on the side of something, glitches out and often floats.) Other than that, it\'s all good! Keep up the good work! Oh and if it were possible, I\'d love more customizations such as... wings/capes, new heads, armor/body and all that. Looking unique is good! ^^","Awesome game, for sure, but I have a few frustrating issues. For one, look controls become janky during raids, making aiming more difficult. Second, and this is a big one for me, there is no Undo Last function when building. We need that, because my third issue is the inconsistent move/look controls during building. Often, the sides of the screen will swap, or the input will fail and I will bore a 10-tile hole into the floor I cannot fill without consuming build points.

With an ipega 9167 connected, the character will move constantly and the gamepad can only change the direction of movement, the character never stops running. No option in gamepad options to configure between joystick or d-pad for movement. Update: made screencapture report to devs, got back a cookie cutter \\"We will definitely keep an eye on this.\\" which actually means \\"we know and don\'t care.\\" so im subtracting a star.","Awesome game. If you like old-school games, then this is one of the best ones. My complaints: the first one is fire suit doesnt exactly protect you from fire attacks, the prices of items go up disproportionately and down at random moments. The items are sometimes just randomly taken out from the store. 2 stars for the ridiculously high prices and taking items out of store. Also, Some ads are mature in nature.","Overall, this game has a lot of potential. Unfortunately, the buttons often have a delayed response (specifically the jump button). It can make it extremely annoying when trying to double jump across a big gap, to get treasures or search for secret areas. Also, there should be a way to configure the button setup. To move them, reorder them, or change their size. If there is a way to do so, I\'ve yet to find it. Other than these 2 things, it\'s a great game.","I very much enjoy this game. Really old school vibe, easy controls, and secret areas to find, reminds me of the good days. The amount of gold you earn vs the costs of stuff is pretty fair, and lots of weapons, gear, and uses for each of them specifically. All in all, nothing negative to say about it! Perhaps being able to customize your character a little more than just the eye/skin color would be cool, just saying lol.","The game is actually really fun. Grinding for loot and gold isn\'t all that bad, plus it gives plenty of incentive to go back to previous levels anyway. The loot is good, it\'s fast-paced, action packed and pretty challenging. I do wish there was inventory management... I know it kind of does it automatically, but not in the order I want it. I also noticed how much easier the enemies died when I payed real money... I got a sword so good it practically forced me to change classes."],"appId":"com.asanteegames.magicrampage","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.asanteegames.magicrampage&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.lemonjamgames.neonimpact":{"title":"Neon Impact","description":"Clicker Endless RPG.

This game, not so much. You have to discard 4 of your towers every time. Desert maps cause overheat, bosses change spawn points at random, your towers always getting stunned. For me these new additions just made the game much more *infuriating*, not more fun. And there\'s not very many maps either. Wool/unlocks were fine. This game is ok, but I would pay money to get the original on Android.","Top tier tower defense game I hate spending money on games. I chose to spend a few bucks to support the developers on this one. Minimal ads. Grinding is minimal. Basically, it lacks the kind of baloney that we have all come to accept as normal for phone games. The game has a unique visual aesthetic. The towers and enemies are carried in a way that requires some strategy. The maps and worlds are varied. Ice, desert, forest. Also a mix of maps that are open or have pre set paths","Pretty decent TD game. You\'re trying to defend against aliens that are trying to kidnap the most intelligent life on Earth (sheep). So far, I have three issues with gameplay. 1) Tesla towers are supposed to attack air and ground units, but seem to only attack ground. 2) in Hard mode there is no way to earn 3 stars. a perfect game will yield 4 stars, but losing one sheep will cost your score two stars. 3) I try to get a perfect score on every map, and I am at a point in the second set of maps where I cannot get a perfect score in Hard mode, so that irks me. But, overall good game.","Can\'t play, sent crash data reports. I use a Samsung galaxy s20 and when I open the app it allows me to login with my Google play. Afterward, I select the button to start but once I select the first stage it turns off. When I close and re open the app it asks me to send crash data, which I obliged. Graphics look decent. Would love to be able to change the rating so if whatever is causing this gets patched and I\'m alerted, ill give it another try.","Just a really fun Tower Defense game... With no ads! No in-your-face micro transactions! Some of the level designs (like the desert levels) can be so challenging, in a good way, that makes you keep coming back. In my opinion, this game is up there with BloonsTD6. Thank you to the developers for making such a charming game."],"appId":"com.limbic.towermadness2","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.limbic.towermadness2&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.maxgames.aow2":{"title":"Age of War 2","description":"Battle your way through the ages in this insanely addicting action/strategy game.

So much of it was garbage, and this, while not the best quality, was very fun. Still fun today. I don\'t mind giving $6 to the creators 10 years later (don\'t actually remember how long it\'s been) after playing it for free for many hours after school. I only wish it were more difficult. They very easy strategy is to let them build up a line of units, march up to your base, and spam range. That way, all of your range (all 10ish) are firing at the same time. Doing massive damage. Good 2 hour time waster to do the campaigns. Music is great","I love the game it is something I used to play a lot however there are a couple of things that are wrong with this. First the A.I is extremely unballanced. It basically has infinite resources turned on and gets really op if u look away from the game for more than 5 seconds. 2 (this one isn\'t that bad but) the 30 second unskipable adds are a bit of a let down and I understand that the games can go on for a very long time so after each one there is an add that is ok but to not be able to skip. No","Nice and fun time killer. Overall great, but gets repetitive pretty quickly. The game does give you options but most of them you have to pay for. Also it doesn\'t feel like any previous games make any progress in the next. Like playing the same thing over and over again without any bonuses from previous victories. Beside that, everything is great. Like the design, artstyle, the general ideas of the characters and the idea of the generation shifting, Overall great game.","Not a game you keep, but definitely worth playing, for a few hours. Can be played offline, gives a lot of Google Play Achievements XP, tough only 2 of the said \'Commanders\' is free. If you\'ve never played the flash game (like me), the trick is to play defensively, until you reach the super unit, in the last age. Stay within your Towers range, don\'t unlock 4th units (to save Gold) and don\'t worry if your opponent has advanced to the next age. \'Hard\' is beatable with this simple strategy.","I really like this game. However when I played the different difficulties I found that medium was too easy and hard is still hard so there\'s no medium really, and the ai isn\'t smarter, just more op. When I also decided to buy the general mode it wouldn\'t work, so I uninstalled and installed it a few times (worked the 4th time) and it unlocked general mode but when I pressed on it, it told me to buy general mode again which is annoying. Overall this game is great just don\'t buy anything."],"appId":"com.maxgames.aow2","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.maxgames.aow2&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.noxgames.hitman.hero.arpg":{"title":"Agent Hero: Action Hitmaster","description":"There is no end to the action in this fast-paced archer like shooter RPG that pulls you straight into a world of non-stop shooting and dodging.

It\'s probably not hard to simply beat every level in some capacity, but 3 stars is nigh impossible on some levels. You don\'t get 3 stars as a reward for playing well, you get it by sheer luck or by using power ups which should not be required, especially since they are RANDOM","The destruction physics are great, I absolutely love watching the castles crumble to the ground. What gets frustrating is that you usually have attempt each level multiple times to get a 3 star score. Those grappling hooks drove me insane. I bowed out at about level 45. Fun & challenging game but there\'s no weapon selection, no story. Just destroy castles and move on & that wears thin after awhile. 4/5!!","Hook = garbage pos. I love these games but unfortunately this one requires the \\"finding one exact angle with one weapon and nothing else will finish the level\\" method on every single level which really take 99% of the fun out of it. I\'ll spend $ on a game that allows more than 1 solution. Also the tap location seems to randomly move at the start of a level, making it difficult to launch projectiles sometimes.","The game sets up rube Goldberg machine situations that don\'t actually work unless you attempt the level many times. It can be really frustrating, but is also quite fun and entertaining when you hit the right weak spot. Overall the game is enjoyable. I just hope the physics continue to get improved. Often I\'ll hit the same spot and nothing will happen, then the next attempt it hits and makes everything fall down!","Great game. There is always a way to destroy each castle so no reason to buy anything if you have patience. I finished the game with the last 25 levels easy pickings taking generally 1-3 tries to complete.

This one is great fun too. However, I absolutely cannot stand how I\'m given an option to watch an ad for extra XP at the end of each mission and if I just choose to move on, because I hate having to watch a video at the end overy single mission, I still get shown a stupid ad. So watch an ad for a bonus! Yay! Oh you don\'t want the bonus? Okay here\'s an ad still but no bonus. Thanks but no thanks. Uninstalling.","This game has a lot to like. It\'s not really for me. I hit a level where a new enemy debuffs all of my towers. Like all of them, it\'s a huge range and duration. Leveled up my towers and abilities a couple of times, but I still get crushed. It\'s not really a matter of strategy or placement, I just need to grind way more. There is a limit to how much fun that is in a Tower Defense game. Replaying the levels you can already crush over and over gets real slow and dull.","Just started playing this, finished the first 3 levels, and I really enjoy the game. Seems balanced and unique. Though it seems that there\'s no cloud backup, and there\'s no way to pay to disable ads. Ads will show up once in a while after you finish a level. I wanna get rid of them by paying, but couldn\'t find a way to do so. Definitely a good alternative for Kingdom Rush lovers out there.","First the bad, the battles can get somewhat long and tedious. Now the good, whether or not you win a battle or gain a star, even if you don\'t, you still gain some exp! Most defense games if you can\'t get through a level you have to pay....but not in this one! Keep going back into the boards you\'ve cleared and eventually you\'ll get exp. To level up and possibly enter new boards.","Does not save progress from one phone to another :( The game itself is fairly fun, but you will need to progress forward to come back and do some of the hard-mode raids. There are times when things are not explained well or the controls are a bit off, like if there are lots of dropped items it can lead to using the wrong ones. Clicking can be a litrle hard on the phone and the Galaxy Note Stylus is completely ignored by some actions you can click."],"appId":"ru.iriysoft.cursedtreasure2","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.iriysoft.cursedtreasure2&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.Roika.Darkrise":{"title":"Darkrise - Pixel Action RPG","description":"Darkrise is a classic hardcore game that was created by two indie developers in nostalgic pixel style. \\n\\nIn this action RPG game you can get acquainted with 3 characters - Alice, Godric and Kira.

Fairly simple and easy to figure out. Just wish that the Archer\'s attack range for the auto targeting was farther. Also want a larger fov. As it is now it\'s only fine if you are a warrior.

Resources are liberal BUT the price of items are high. So be prepared for a lot of farming for resources and experience points.

Dreaming Dimension is now released to the formal track. During the beta period, we optimized the game a lot and added Russian. We hope you can keep loving this beautiful indie game. Thanks for your support! ","comments":["It\'s really fun and a cool concept. My only big issue with it is that it should save your progress upon exiting. When I first downloaded it, I was on break at work and went through and beat the first boss, but then I had to get back on my shift and there was no option to save and exit. I hoped maybe it did it by default, but nope. I had to start all iver again. Seems like the playthroughs might be fairly long, so you shouldn\'t be obligated to sit all the way through one in one shot.","So far it\'s pretty good in the genre. Some cards are missing text after an upgrade and the menu area is kinda hard to navigate (can I just get a Talents button I don\'t have to walk to?) But overall pretty fun. Some grammar/spelling errors on one or two of the loading texts and generally slow progression toward other characters, but a well developed and fun game all in all. I\'d call it one of the best mobile options available.","The game seems ok, but most of the time each character only has one build they can run if they want to win with a specific character. It was fun, but a couple things annoyed me. First of all, half of the characters you can\'t even unlock without buying them with real money. I wish they would have given you the choice between a lot of in-game money or real money if you want to speed it up. Second, I don\'t get why they make the easier difficulties harder when there are harder ones already.","The game always crashes at the loading screen, it\'s also laggy & slow. The game looks similar to vs fight, in that game I was among the top players, if this game is any similar it should be very awesome. It\'s the only reason I\'m willing to give it a try. My only concern is the talent, relic & equipment. These sort of things remove power from cards & dilute strategy making the game more about levels & what upgrades/items you have over the enemy. Vs fight is no longer functional now cause of p2w.","Was playing fine a week ago. Game was fun and challenging esp. after unlocking the hidden boss per level. That was fine. But when I played this week, it keeps on lagging when I select different areas in the screen. Also after defeating certain enemies. I checked my internet connection but it was fine. The problem seems to be in-game. Hopefully the devs will look into it."],"appId":"com.loongcheer.tcg.deckadventure","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.loongcheer.tcg.deckadventure&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.funstudio.dungeonheroes":{"title":"Dungeon: Age of Heroes","description":"Embark on a dangerous and exciting adventure across the fantastic kingdom of Jatran.

Sadly though the game heavily relies on ads. Not just from screens, but being able to progress your character. Very slow advancement with increasing diffuculty promotes purchases to get anywhere. On the plus side, the graphics are top notch. The world map style is fantastic. The music is wonderful. Otherwise the game is virtually unplayable without money.","It\'s a pretty fun game. There are some things that could be fixed: the first or second line of the tutorial doesn\'t make sense, the description of the small health potion is incomplete, and the biggest issue is that enemies only agro if you are in a square to the left/right/up/down of them which allows one of your abilities to damage enemies without them noticing. I can kill bosses way above my level without taking damage.","I like this game. Good design, entertaining. The one problem I have is with the inventory system. I have items but I can\'t add them to my character. I have 3 rings of dodge but can\'t use them. Under the item screen, I try to click on an item and does nothing. I couldn\'t change items during adventures. I just can\'t give the game 5 stars because of the inventory management. Otherwise good game.","It started out good, even having to go through annoying ads to gain more crystals and gold was mildly acceptable. But now I have everything I could find on the map conquered, and its just now boring. I am looking forward to new dungeons. Could complete only one of the three Lair of Evil dungeons, to stsge 34, and the other two to stsges 36. Load progress would show 0% for some time, then revert back to map. I do like the game though. Keep up the good work!","Pros: Nice music and backdrop. You feel like your in a dungeon. Cons: im going to nitpick: all the other characters are behind a pay wall. Don\'t get me wrong, bills have to be paid (I\'m not going to knock a person\'s ability to get the bag). You can unlock them through watching ads (and they give you a discount if you unlock all if them at once with real money; not sure if that\'s for a limited time or not), so they understand.

The cut scene art style is subpar, and the dialogue translation is rough... But I\'m already fond of the combat mechanics and stat system. Hell, if someone translated the native language first, I\'d happily just clean it up myself! I\'m interested to see the direction this game takes. A solid investment of time, at the very least.","Excellent game! Progress is just hard enough to be satisfying, but not so hard that it\'s discouraging. My only complaint is the limited skillset. There are four skills and four masteries per character, but they top out pretty quickly with no further improvement opportunities. It keeps the game simple though, so I suppose that\'s a trade-off. All told, I applaud the developers. Well done, chaps, well done.","This is one of the best mobile games I\'ve played in a long time. The story is exciting and engaging, and their add system is optional-watch an add to get a prize or double your gold. Everything is doable without spending $$$. More challenging levels are available after you beat normal. Like them on Facebook and get a coupon to get a great welcome package too!","I haven\'t played the game for very long yet, however it does seem to have a interesting and decent story up to where I am. the controls are pretty standard as similair games go, I prefer the joystick to be stationary and the combat system is a little different but not necessarily in a bad way. You run around a defined area attacking the enemies that are presented. Overall it isna fun game and I do enjoy the anime stylings. Good job developers. :)","I really enjoy the story. But sadly can\'t go back and re-read it if i am trying to show it to anyone. It had a skip option first time through so I assumed if I went back to any mission I could read or skip the story but nope. Also the story does not reflect difficulty while playing, if you had a tough time with a level having to retry many times they might still say it was easy in the story. I am currently stuck on a boss, and the grind is getting wearing without any story."],"appId":"com.gacogames.epiccon","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gacogames.epiccon&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.EvoTApps.GameOfEvolution":{"title":"Game of Evolution: Idle Clicker & Merge Life","description":"Human evolution is fun!\\nMake your way from an ameba to space traveling.

Very colorful, adorable, and surprising creatures show up and it doesn\'t take too long to progress through the ages/eras. Haven\'t fully reached the space part yet but so far I am addicted! The ads are not excessive and mostly there\'s some form of reward for watching AND if the video glitches...you get the reward anyway! THAT\'S how ya get a 5 star rating \ud83d\ude06 Looking at you, Covet Fashion \ud83d\ude44 I love a game that doesn\'t take literally YEARS to hit level 5. Nice game! P.S. it\'s ELON Musk \ud83d\ude06","Lovin\' this game! I\'ve always been a big fan of evolution-based games and this one quickly became a favorite. Very easy to spend hours playing. The best part is that the ads are optional...they dont pop up every 30 seconds like they do in most other free games these days! Kudos to the developers! *Only had 1 problem: when I moved the game storage to my SD card it wouldn\'t open, it just kept crashing. Once I realized what the problem was and moved it back to internal storage everything was OK.","I thought this game was going to end when we reached the modern era. But the game goes beyond that, into outer space. Aliens! I like that... Why 4 stars? Some ad offers automatically try to open the download page after the ad finishes playing, though I tap on the X. I don\'t know if it\'s done on the app\'s side or if it\'s how the advertiser set it up. It gets kind of frustrating at times.","Gameplay is ok, and the characters are cute. There are a couple of super annoying things though: sometimes lifesparks spawn or drift behind the on-screen menu buttons and you can\'t tap on them until they drift back out. And the other thing is when you\'re tapping on a character that earns more coins and another, lower value character drifts in front of it. You have to keep dragging your character away from the other characters so you get the most coins per tap.","Addictive! Love it. It took me a while to realize that I could get new creatures by watching ads but once I figured that out the game took off like a rocket \ud83d\ude80. I literally can\'t stop playing - it\'s become my favorite game. Graphics /animations could use a little improvement but that\'s minor with game play being as much fun as this is.

Kind of retro and easy moving. Good for relaxing with, but not TOO easy. Still requires a little strategy and attention. Not the same old same old. Edit: i have beaten the game on normal and am trying difficult level. It is very challenging now. Advanced players need not worry that the game is too easy now. In fact I\'m not sure i can beat it on the harder setting, it\'s tough! (but still fun).","This is a fantastic game! Great depth in both story and gameplay. The strategy is simple with enough elements to make it challenging. Incorporating a time, terrain, resource, stamina, and skill system that makes it easy to understand without being boring. I was addicted right away, couldn\'t stop playing, and didn\'t have to pay anything to complete. You should play this game too. Go Griblers!","No ads. Absolutely free. Others have accurately described the game. I just wanted to add my voice to confirm that this is completely ad free. The developers give you the option about five or six times (after completing key missions) to donate $2 if you are enjoying the game. (I think they called it upgrading to premium, but it was really just giving you the chance to donate. The complete game is free.) I finished it without having to spend a penny (after which I paid the $2 because was worth it)","Really really fun game. No p2w at all. Cool concept and really responsive developers. Few things I would suggest would be: Automation to make tasks easier. Like being able to set a destination and Gribler makes it automatically. Replaying the mini text rpg. I clicked skip by mistake and couldn\'t solve it. Maybe a mine in the tree city just like we have a farm.","if you like counting every third turn and constantly managing inventory then boy oh boy is this the game for you. I\'m pretty surprised at the rating for this game. It\'s super simplistic, it makes you change characters every few steps, and you are in Perpetual Inventory management mode a good deal of the time because they throw a million items at you and give you a limited set of expandable but still Limited inventory slots. Exactly the opposite kind of game I like.

When you watch an ad it immediately brings you to the play store and when you try and go back to the game it restarts the game. I was almost at the end of a level and I died so I watched an ad (easy way out I know) and this happened to me and made me do the whole level over again, which pretty much defeats the purpose of the ad, huh. Other than that great game, a little laggy sometimes but that might just be my phone.","I love this game. The graphics are great, the characters are cool, the bikes are cool, and the guns are cool. My only big problem is that when you progress in the game, there\'s a lot of objects, that can kill you, in the way (porta john\'s, fireballs, dumpsters). Don\'t get me wrong, there should be obstacles in the way, but there\'s almost a ridiculous amount of them. Other than that, great game \ud83d\udc4d\u270c\ufe0f","Fantastic, Simple, Addictive fun. As a fan of heavily-stylized games like CounterSpy, TF2, and the like, this game is a breath of fresh air from the usual stuff on the app store from the art style alone. As for its gameplay, this game plays a lot like early racing games like OutRun with plenty of unique enviroments, vehicles, weapons and characters. You can only use your gun at select moments, but when you do, its pretty cool. On top of all that, running over dead people gets you $. 10/10 lol","It has enough mechanics to keep it interesting. Some of it could easily be better like the shooting and bimb throwing. If you made it so that you actually have to aim, itd add a skill requirement and give the game more difficulty and potential for different difficulty levels. Other stuff is way too easy too, and the game focuses a bit on being monetizable, like alot of mobile games. Those things hold it back, but it\'s core gameplay isnt bad & it could easily be improved on to make it way better.","Great game, very satisfying to play. Been playing for just a day and felt compelled to spend $2 to remove ads. It\'s not that the ads were obnoxious either, just that it\'s such a good game I didn\'t want any down time between runs lol. Well worth a shot for free. No need to spend anything if you dont want. To the developers though, there was one small technical issue for me. The sounds have quite a disparity in volume. Adding seperate sliders to music and FX would be great."],"appId":"com.makabaka.hellrider3","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.makabaka.hellrider3&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.weirdjohnny.idle.rpg":{"title":"Hero Tale - Idle RPG","description":"Adventure of the boy on the medieval fantasy island.\\nBeat enemies to become stronger, loot items from them and customize your equipment fitting to your strategy.

First, while it\'s supposed to be an idle game you must pay $10 to buy the \\"Caretaker\\" for that privilege. Second, everything is attached to 30sec-1min ads which is another $10 to buy the \\"nibbler\\" to remove, which leads to the third issue of the constant push for that purchase every few ads. Fourth, it is possible to permanently mess up a schools evaluations with no ability to fix","Love it, pretty fun! Dont even mind the ads on this 1 really (even if there are a TON if you want to progress quickly.) The problem is the app keeps crashing on me, most often after I\'ve watched an ad (and oc i dont get a reward for completeing those.) Two times I\'ve gone back to find it didnt even autosave the last minute or so. Which doesnt seem like a lot but then i have to rewatch ads or something to get the money back. So yea, love it but pls fix it.","very high quality gameplay, very enjoyable, doesn\'t bombard you with ads unless you\'re going to earn something from it. removal of ads is reasonably priced. game is able to be finished within a month or two depending on the amount you play, but if you don\'t play often, it lasts a long time. it\'s also still im development, with new colleges being added.","This game has cute graphics and neat looking wizards/witches to level up and gear up, but the game has too little of content and I found myself not having any goals to accomplish. I hold the top rank at over 880k wizard tower score but find the game to be too boring even as an idle game. I completed 90% of content in the first two weeks. Months of grinding had lead to no new content.The final level appears to be false hope as it seems the developers have abandoned the game. Would not recommend.","I\'ll give it a solid 4, very cool game and I just finished watching Harry Potter series which is kinda funny. My only problem is, is that it isn\'t the developers problem really more or so my phone\'s problem because my camera was put on the screen so I can\'t see how much gold I have, I hope the developers see this and hopefully change where the gold and other things are placed because if I had to guess other people who have the same phone deal with the same problem.

Only thing I want is a more in-your-face story, it\'s kind of just passersby at the moment and I liked it in Half-Life, I can definitely grow to like it here.","I absolutely love the first game and it made me get into this pixel rpg genre, and when I saw this game on my suggested I couldn\'t believe it. The first Game holds a special place in my heart and I hope this game is as good if not goes beyond my expectations of the first game.","This game is a real gem! Very satisfying on-screen controls.

Its really fun gameplay and with all of the classes to choose from and master, there\'s always something you can do differently. The one complaint I have is optimization. Whenever a ton of enemies are on screen, or when a lot of magic effects are visible, the game lags unbearably. Please add resolution modifiers or something, just to make gameplay past 25 minutes actually playable. Other than that, everything is perfect.","Huge fan for years now! Love the update with new magic, artifacts, and abilities, it was definitely due. If you like upgrading and exploring different fighting styles this is for you. This is slow to start, then exponentially increases with difficulty but so does your characters abilities. There is a point where defense matters more then offense. I\'ve tried both ways and still can only last 20-30 min average. The story is slightly convoluted. 1 ad for 1 revive is nice. Best played w/ stylus pen.","One of the best phone games. Very limited adds. Rogue-Like \\"Asteroids\\" game. The joystick control takes a bit to get used to and master, but try the different joy-stick options to find the best for you. The developer seems invested, or was when I was playing this game heavily. Lots to unlock, and you\'ll easily be entertained for 20-60 minutes per run.","This is such a refreshing take on the infinite survivor. The core loop of leveling up, gaining new spells, and finding items is addicting. The spell evolutions are great & offer a lot of possibilities, especially with the new system they recently implemented, removing the need to sacrifice a spell to evolve another. The ads arn\'t too annoying & removing them is very reasonably priced. If you have played Vampire Survivor, this is right up your alley.","Kind of miss the old feature of combining two maxed out skills into a superpower, didn\'t get much time exploring that, also think the fireball looked a bit better before it was changed. Overall, really great game, tho. Love the different builds you can come up with, and how op you can get. I kinda think it would be fun to have a map with no level cap, just cause I want to try and get all of everything.

The only thing I\'d say should be added is a feature to see what an item in your inventory can be used to craft, so that you don\'t have to search each crafter looking for how to use a rare item taking up inventory space","Absolutely wonderful, this is a game for the hard core and casual players. If you want to grind for the best gear possible be ready to buckle down to the grind. I love the hero selection and all the different monsters and materials I get to fight and collect. The game can feel repetitive at times but you have more than enough content over time to have fun. However, I do wish there where more heros add to the game over time becouse that does get a bit boring once you have reached a certain point","I personally found it a bit tedious after a while, but the core concept is fun. It just got to a point where I had like 10 heroes, and manually assigning them every few minutes wasn\'t fun. The game tries to do a lot of things okay, whereas if l could just focus on one piece I might enjoy it more. Managing the shop was not nearly as fun as watching the heroes get stronger, but it\'s a bit barebones. Good, just not great.","Quite the fun time waster. There is always something to do here and you will quickly lose count of how long you\'ve spent playing. Training heroes while running a shop was a really fun interaction for a while, but it seemed to cut off pretty abruptly (I never prestiged them). Great if you have a lot of spare time, but can be a huge time sink otherwise.","I don\'t think I\'ve had a bad experience either time I\'ve played this game, especially since aside from the actual DLC, you can reasonably access everything with in game currency. And the fact that anything I buy is permanently mine is (unfortunately) refreshing. The art is great, the prices feel worth it, and the game so far feels like they put a lot of love into this.

It\'s simple, cathartic, linear. But now it is almost unplayable through the ads. Every time I open the shop or click a box, I cringe knowing there\'s a 75% chance it\'s going to pop up an ad. Not only that, but the banner ads create a huge amount of lag on my phone and on my chromebook. They broke the game to make money.","I wish I could rate this 4.5 stars. This game is fun and addicting! The prestige option makes the game fun. The mystery box is a great addition to the game. The special mines are fun also. There are few ads. There is one problem though, the in-app purchases do not work. If this problem gets fixed, I will remove the part about the problem and rate this game 5 stars.","I am addicted to this game! It\'s the simplest of all game models but something about it is just so satisfying. One improvement I would like to see is an option to turn off Mystery Boxes. Mystery Boxes tend to give the player a clutter of gems, being able to turn this off would create an even greater challenge to achieving a higher \\"score\\".","This could be a great game. A few issues though... To do any kind of upgrade you have to watch an ad. I don\'t have a problem with watching ads but you can\'t always watch an ad with one click. Multiple clicks are required and most times you can\'t view the ad so you get no upgrade. I\'ve tried to purchase \\"ad free\\" but it doesn\'t work. I\'ve emailed the developers and get zero response.","Overall I like this game, the graphics are simple and pretty, and it\'s a great time waster. However I have had some issues with it recently, the game doesn\'t fit my screen correctly with parts too close or even partially off the screen, and the achievements like to bug out, making duplicates that dont advance in progress."],"appId":"com.gramgames.london.mergegems","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gramgames.london.mergegems&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.mergegame.merge":{"title":"Merge Inn - Tasty Match Puzzle","description":"Have you visited the cozy Merge Inn?

If an ad doesn\'t load, it still counts against you and you can\'t watch another ad to get the energy bonus (or other bonuses), sometimes the game will freeze and I have to relaunch the app, but this usually happens when I\'m watching an ad, so again I don\'t get the bonus and I\'ve wasted my time. I was able to live with getting limited ads for bonuses, but when everything freezes or gets glitchy I don\'t really want to play anymore.","I like this merge game a lot more than some others out there. I feel that with the clubs, the timer between asking for energy is a bit much unless you set a timer to go on. About 25% of the adds glitch and then won\'t let you retry to get either the energy or food item. Decent game if you can deal with it \ud83d\udc4d but could definitely fix a few things","Very addictive! Just really like this game. P.s. to those that can\'t get enough play time-watch a few very short videos! To those that worked so hard on this game \ud83c\udf89 keep up the great work! 8/22/2022 update: I really like this game but it does nothing but cheat me now! Ever since the update for \\"clubs\\" it crashes continuously and when it\'s not crashing it lags so very bad. Please fix it! I don\'t want to have to find another game...","Best of these types of games I\'ve played so far. More lenient storage options, ability to watch ads to get more energy a few times a day. The new clubs are why I\'ve taken a star..I\'ll return it when they\'re not so buggy. Can\'t give energy to people I know I haven\'t yet, but says I gave them energy (they\'ve gotten zero help yet, yet I can\'t help them?)","The ads are glitchy and you only get so many. Alright, still a good game. I enjoyed playing it. Then the game just stopped giving me ads. I cannot get more energy to play with. This makes things incredibly tedious. I\'m probably going to uninstall. Also! The Mint side event is very stressful. It\'s timed, so it feels like I should work on that instead. But it takes too much energy and doesn\'t give enough back."],"appId":"com.mergegame.merge","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mergegame.merge&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.wjoy.witch":{"title":"Merge Witches-Match Puzzles","description":"Are you looking for merge games, puzzle games, free games, girls games? \\nThen \\"Merge Witches\\" will surely be a great target for you!\\n\\nThere was a peaceful and mysterious sky city, where the cute witches lived a calm life.

Pros: they add new regular levels and special challenges often, you get some gems playing, you can have fun without having to spend money or connect with \\"friends,\\" and the interface isn\'t too overwhelming. Cons: it takes up a lot of space and takes forever to load initially, the camp quests take literal months of daily play to complete one sequence (the books, omg), and some of the special level types are duds. But overall fun if this is your type of thing.","I love this game. The graphics are super cute and there is plenty to keep busy with. My one issue is space...and I have paid to unlock extra space. I have so many bubbles accumulated that hold items I don\'t have space for and I don\'t want to just keep getting rid of everything but all those accumulated items sitting there irritates me. I\'m not new to merge games but maybe I\'m missing something in this one that is the cause of me not opening space a little faster?","It\'s a cute game, but actual game PLAY is very limited due to the characters (witches) have only enough energy to do about 3 or 4 activities before they must sleep. That\'s it, 3, maybe 4 things if you\'re lucky, then they\'re out of commission for a while unless you\'re willing to pay to wake them up. You do have islands to explore, but the cost of each exploration is fairly high considering the exploration lasts mere seconds, then you\'re on to the next one, paying another exorbitant price.","This is a fun game and I enjoy it, but it would be great if the witches didn\'t sleep all the time. Makes progress very slow when only one or two witches are awake at a time. Or you have to pay to wake up a witch to harvest. That could definitely be improved upon. Update: After playing this game for awhile, the game is even better. So much to do! Takes awhile to build the game up, but well worth it. Love the games. Just wish we could keep the eggs we win in the games along with coins.","Update: after playing for several days I\'ve found plenty to do to keep one busy for at least 20 minutes. I really like the separate merge levels the best...Just loaded this app, played 5 minutes and apparently can\'t do anything for 20 minutes as the witches are sleeping. I will be uninstalling if thats the way it continues. I\'ll give it a day then decide."],"appId":"com.wjoy.witch","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wjoy.witch&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.sanctumstudio.mochicat":{"title":"Mochicats Collection","description":"Mochicats are carefree and enjoy eating and playing around. \\n\\nThey can eat as much dessert as you feed them, like they will never get enough of it! \\n\\nThey also love making new friends!

Plays well, it\'s fun, addictive, and definitely relaxing to me. However, I don\'t know what\'s been happening with the ads, but they sometimes make the game crash. I\'ve had my phone forcefully restart twice because of them. I have to spam my fingers all over the screen to hopefully prevent it. Aside from that scary inconvenience, it\'s an overall good game with good mochi buddies.","It\'s cute! You can\'t really play it 24/7 but it\'s great for when you\'re awkwardly sitting in public or are bored at home. It\'s easy to learn and the ads aren\'t long, nor does it force you to watch them. A few minor bugs I\'ve experienced a couple times like things being misplaced or not responding to touch but changing tabs in game fixes it. I love the art style a lot and mindless tapping games help my anxiety \ud83d\udc95","This game is so adorable! I love how it doesn\'t blast you with ads like most games these days. Ads are more a tool for bonus rewards, IF you want it, such I love. All of the interaction with the cats is cute, progress is as fast as you want it to be, and you can play for a long time without the game kicking you out for lack of energy. If I were to have one critique, maybe I would say that the UI is a bit busy and sometimes they overlap with each other which makes it hard to see what\'s going on.","This game is great and very fun/easy to play, although i do have one complaint. I believe your friend system may be broken. Me and my other friend who plays this game have tried sending friend requests multiple times, but we never seem to receive them. It\'s kind of a letdown and i really hope you can fix this soon. It seems like a simple fix, really. So far, this is the only bug i\'ve come across! Keep up the great work.","Due to the new update the game is unplayable for me it just crashes nonstop, quite disappointed in that. I just installed it 2 days ago and then it started crashing after I updating. Currently will be at 2 stars until it is fixed. On another note the design of the cats during the game play I was able to do are so adorable. I just wish I could play it without the crashing."],"appId":"com.sanctumstudio.mochicat","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sanctumstudio.mochicat&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.gg.moduleTd":{"title":"Sci-Fi Tower Defense Module TD","description":"Are you looking for a tower defense offline game with thrilling td strategy gameplay?\\nDo you want this td defense to also be an offline game so you can play it anywhere with no data / no wifi?\\n\\nTry Module TD \u2013 the best td game in the td defence genre.

If you can\'t progress without paying, you just don\'t understand the game. Ignore the ads, wait 30 seconds, and get the cash you need to upgrade. I suggest you play the normal mode on all levels, use your cash to upgrade until you\'re stuck. Then go back to level 1 and play hard mode until you\'re stuck. This gives you enough money to upgrade towers and continue to progress on normal. Rinse and repeat. You must strive for 3 stars on each level. Great game! Story is silly...","Good relaxing true tower defense. With plenty of strategy and kickin graphics. Also adding the pause button allows time to strategies upgrades. Instead of tapping my fingers off. Over all, it\'s a well put together game. Only reason i could not give it 5 stars. Is due to the fact that I could only find one way to perfect each level so far. But even so, thanks for an awesome tower defense game.","It\'s a fun tower defence game, albeit pretty hard. I came across a game breaking bug though-when I tap the screen to start some levels, it zooms in just slightly and then doesn\'t let me scroll to the buttom parts of the map where I need to place towers. Most maps work fine fine when it does it but I\'m on level 38 and it\'s impossible to pass. I don\'t know if this game gets updated anymore but I\'m hoping it does to fix this, I was really enjoying it.","This game is pretty fun. The devs did a great job on the graphics, the level designs, the sci fi aesthetic, and the upgrade system. It can be frustratingly challenging, but also rewarding when you finally beat a tough level. The only thing that\'s lacking is a better description of the powerups (English not their first language, but they usually try).","Overall the game is good. The mechanics are clean, the graphics are good, the responsiveness is decent, the content is what you would expect of a typical tower defense. The downside is the eventuality of forced MTX. You get to a certain point in the game where it is damn near unbeatable and begins to feel like a waste of time. Progression is stunted by the extreme difficulty escalation early on. Just another throw-away app at the end of the day. Had fun, but I refuse to contribute to a p2w game."],"appId":"com.gg.moduleTd","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gg.moduleTd&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.dungeon.rpg.freeherowars":{"title":"Monster Dungeon:Hunting Master","description":"Hero, the world is shattering, it\u2019s time to head to the RPG world, start your adventure to eliminate all monsters to bring the peace back to the world.\\nNow we represent the Monster Dungeon:Hunting Master to all the people who are enthusiastic for RPG, it is an idle MMORPG game with addicting gameplays and endless raid and dungeon, no time to more talk, just come and have a try.\\n\\nIn Monster Dungeon:Hunting Master, you will play as a lone hero to fight against creepy monsters in the desolate land, head to the raid and start your own adventure, it will be a unique and dramatic journey.

Weeeeellllll maybe cuz of the music.","Yeah, this is like dungeon chronicles., but so far i like the graphics .hopefully you do much better than the original. having a save data is a must .and more weapons to choose aside from Sword/gun/staff. or have a subclasses and have a character customization aside from costumes. but this is just a suggestions only.. I think this game will be more interesting in the future ..\ud83e\udd70","Do the sacred objects have any use? Is the only way to get red gems is to use REAL money?

I\'ve been finding myself last in this game for hours. And most of those hours are forced ads as you unlock new areas. I didn\'t mind them at first but after awhile it got very annoying, so I ended up buying the wolf skin which comes with ad free. Ad free lasted maybe 10 minutes or less to then BOOM, smacks me with an ad. Kinda pissed me off and unfortunately I don\'t think I wanna play it anymore.","Updated the game and it completely reset all of my progress. I was on world 3, which starts on a beach but was stuck on getting coins so I tried traveling back to world 2 but the boat that connects the two areas there was gone and so I couldn\'t mine to get gold so I decided to update and see if that would help. Worst mistake ever. I\'ve been playing this game on and off for while and having everything reset to the beginning has ruined it for me.","This game is very fun! Biggest down side is how often it crashes. The longest I have gone without a crash is 5 minutes. I don\'t mind the ads but evertime I get an ad it makes the game crash. If you watch an ad for items it\'ll make the game crash 90% of the time. Some times the control of the character will get stuck and you can\'t make him stop going that direction then it crashes after your character gets eaten by sharks. If your able to put up with all of it, it\'s a very fun game.","The game is fun no joke but there\'s WAY to many ads. Almost after every group of chopping/mining something for supplies it gives a short ad. AND there\'s a box of free supplies that pops up on the ground at times that wants you watch a ad in order to open it. It\'s annoying to have so many ads everywhere and it really disturbs the fun to have ads pop up every 30 seconds.","Update: Started playing again and it is having lots of glitching, freezing and crashing going on! Makes it almost impossible to enjoy. NEEDS 2 B FIXED!! (April 2022) Great for mindless down time! It\'s fun, and the new skins and dungeons are nice. I wish we could access them without being online however. There\'s too many ads to really have fun unless you\'re offline. Ads are good to get extra supplies, but every few seconds or after crafting every new land section?

While unique, I feel like I\'ve heard the story before, but I can\'t figure out where. The game has something to offer, it stays with you. The visuals are amazing, they give a pixeled, gamey setting, but calming music. The music gets less calm the more you go on, making it more curious. The characters are present, they\'re interesting to listen to. In the end, you miss it, but the story can\'t continue.","This game.. in the beginning... it was cute. It was simple. It was challenging. It was good. The items got me addicted honestly. But then.. in the end.. with that twist.. then it got deep. And then it was even better. Totally got me. And there are still more achievements to unlock afterwards. I love this game. If there were more levels or a similar game by these creators, I would totally play it. 10/10 would play again.","Best game ever. Not only is the music good, but the gameplay is smooth and polished, in addition to the story and unexpected turn on events that unfold. I must say though, some levels do rely on a bit of luck (such as out of sight shooty thingies), but overall while it was frustrating I personally didn\'t mind them too much. I finished the game with all cat foods, I only noticed they have a use for them at the end unfortunately xD The ending was amazing.","While it\'s very fun and well put together, I do have a few gripes. It feels like a lot of the puzzles require you to know all the gimmicks beforehand, and that there are a lot of things left to chance. Level 3-14 serves as excellent example of both of these, as it was unclear where to go after pressing down the button, and the fan had 50-50 a chance of killing the player.","Its a decent platformer with some flaws. One thing is the momentum will kill you more than anything else. You can barely change your momentum when you\'re in the air. Also I have found some bugs: - immediately going into a flower after bouncing off of a sideways mushroom can result in upwards momentum as if it were vertical. - the moveable blocks in world 2 that you can switch places with are invisible (excepted the blue arrow above it), idk if it\'s intentional."],"appId":"com.kotobagames.namelesscat","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kotobagames.namelesscat&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.chillyroom.zhmr.gp":{"title":"Otherworld Legends","description":"\\"The best warriors from different times and spaces are summoned to the mirage created by Asurendra.

It\'s fun and challenging making you think about how to tackle certain situations. The Kung Fu girl is the first and only character you get for free. Her kit is simple, fast, and strong. You can playthrough the game with just her. The other characters are to be payrd for and offer a different set of stats and mechanics for fighting. I recommend giving it a try. It won\'t hurt \ud83d\udc4d\u2728","Love this game. Each characters have several skills that you can choose one from which is really cool. The con is in higher difficulties you have to be mobile and have lots of Crowd Control because unflinchable elites can chase you down and destroy you. IMBA mode is where it\'s really fun because you get 2 skills plus you can equip all the artifacts and certain combos are devastating. Major con is it has Multi-player but I never see anybody on, and my phone seriously lags when too much goes on","have played this game for over 2 years now, I\'ve seen it grow and change and I have to say I am still looking forward to an update drop and a new character to play. The combat for each character is unique and items can be combined in fun ways you can learn to experiment with. The pixel art and animation is also amazing. For the flaws of the game the new online feature can be rough at times. Finding or setting up a room can at times be impossible. Also I\'ve had multiple games lag out well into.","Very fun game and replayable. The only reason for not being 5 star is because the Online multi-player definitely needs some work. Can\'t create sessions, so therefore can\'t find any sessions. Then when you rarely do, the session times out or horrendous lag ruins the experience. My only complaint. The currency and gameplay are heavy free to play thankfully.","A fun, free roguelike! Reminiscent of a lot of great games, like Risk of rain 2 and Dead cells! The first few difficulties are easy to beat, but Real mirage is exponentially harder. It\'s nice that once you get to that point, there are stillore things to do, and you won\'t get bored trying over and over again to beat the hardest difficulty. Rarely crashes or lags out. Beautiful art and ost ect ect. The only problem I have is that characters are behind a paywall.

The game is amazing, and really requires advanced strategy. The people complaining that the game gives you bad cards and takes away good ones don\'t realize the cards will always work well if you use them strategically and study card patterns of advanced enemies. The game gets harder as you go on, which is great. But it takes a lot of brainpower. So if it isn\'t a game for you, don\'t leave a bad review just because it\'s not a good match.","One of the best games I\'ve ever had the pleasure of playing. Visuals simple yet lovely and fantastic. Plenty of free collectibles such as gameplay buffs, cosmetics, and even hidden lore if you\'re into that. The gameplay is a perfect concoction of simple cards that turn into large and everchanging scenarios which grow in difficulty as you progress. Fun enough to love, addicting enough to keep my attention. Can even be played offline. Purchases are nice and not intrusive like other mobile apps.","Hi! Got into the game again after a long break from my \\"no comment\\" 5 stars. Just one thing to say now. If a ad plays and you click out, there is a chance that the music will start up again and will layer over the one already playing. You can stack this glitch by clicking out and back in. Note: I deleted my save data to get a fresh start for the changes since the review of 1/30/2021.","One of my favorites. It\'s a simple, yet very good, unique deck builder. Haven\'t found another like it. The ads aren\'t bad nor very long. Can be a little slow going because you need to remember what the opponent is playing but it gets better the more you play. The skins are nice but too expensive for my taste. I will spend the $4.99 that basically \\"buys\\" the game and a few extras. But I\'m still a little confused what the 15.99, 11.99, and 9.99 skin packages offer out side of character costume?","The game\'s pretty fun and decently complex, and I love the dark aesthetics. However, I don\'t know if it\'s a fault of my device or not, but the font of the texts in-game are way too big. Often getting cut off at the side or bottom of my screen, or the words are getting cut, and the remaining letters are being forced down another line. Could there be a way to fix this? Maybe an option to adjust text size? Cause it\'s obvious to me that this game wasn\'t standardized for English."],"appId":"com.phantomrosegame.phantomRoseScarlett","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.phantomrosegame.phantomRoseScarlett&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.d3p.mpq":{"title":"MARVEL Puzzle Quest: Hero RPG","description":"MARVEL Puzzle Quest is the original Match 3 Super Hero Game!

I think the devs need to change the points system on the story challenges. When you replay a match after the opponents level goes up should should get more points not less. Or start the opponent at a higher level and get the full points than work your way down. Lower level=less points, not higher level=less points.","Pros: Game consistantly adds new characters. Its allowed me to get more familiar with lesser known Marvel characters. If you continue to play over the years (I\'m on year 7), then the game doesn\'t really cost anything to play because you can get all of the resources that you need for free. They (designers) keep a repetitive color matching puzzle game interesting. Cons: It a repetitive color matching puzzle game. In the beginning it will cost newer players money if they want to keep up.","Great game, but they\'ve made a lot of missteps. They\'ve corrected nearly all the GUI issues from before, but now they\'ve changed certain events where only specific characters can be used. This shuts everyone from progressing in the game unless they\'ve collected and leveled up the required characters. It may be an attempt to make people pay money to purchase the required characters. I have no issue spending money on a game that I enjoy, however I don\'t like the idea of pay to win.","I played this awhile ago and uninstalled it after a few days. I came back again recently and ended up starting over rather than wherever Ieft off. I started to play and seemed fun at the beginning, but then I went to the subreddit and started to research how to level, best characters, etc. From what I\'ve read, if going the F2P route it is SUPER grindy, and will take years to get to end game level. I am starting to recall why I uninstalled a couple of years ago now, and I think I\'ll do it again.","I\'ve been playing this game for years. It is so hard to get the actually covers you really want/need without paying. There should be a way where you can do a \\"one time\\" swap or a system to swap out covers for other similar covers. For examples 3 stars for 3 stars, 4 stars for 4 stars and 5 stars for 5 stars. There are to many covers and I\'m constantly getting the same ones. For some of us who don\'t play versus or play casually. It is almost impossible to get what you want/need.

If you notice a bug, please contact us via support@quadline.ikovalov.com","comments":["After finishing the game I\'m revising my review. The crossroads were enjoyable since they had some genuine challenging levels but still solvable. Overall sleak, clean, and fun. Bonus levels were hit-or-miss in terms of difficulty. I\'m nitpicky with the difficulty but overall well thought out and developed game. Cons: ads became a bit obnoxious, when offline ads sometimes go black, when offline unlocking bonus levels achievement is unattainable and doesn\'t get awarded when back online.","Wonderful game! I beat the majority of it in less than 2 hours, besides the bottom right of the bonus levels, which took over half an hour of its own. It\'s unique yet simple, so I really enjoyed it! I wouldn\'t says its overall challenging (besides that one level), so I\'d definitely say others should try it out!","Really enjoyed playing through this game. There\'s a good range of difficulty and the game does an excellent job of introducing new mechanics. One thing I would love to see in the future is a level editor, due to the format of the game I think having user- made levels would be huge. I found ads to be a little intrusive but not overbearing.","Amazing puzzle game. Simple, but tough and can get pretty complex at times. Really works out your brain. My only complain is that it was sort of short, since I beat it all and got all achievements in only 2 days, so I hope some more content gets added someday. Also the bottom right level in the \\"bonus levels\\" section was the only truly annoying level in the game, to the point that I just spammed the squares until it clicked. 10/10.","Good puzzles, but after a while, you start getting long three part ads after every other puzzle, and the puzzles are quite short. This means more time watching ads then doing puzzles. I get it, ads are necessary in a free to play game, but too many and you drive players like me, who quite enjoy the game, away."],"appId":"com.IvanKovalov.quadline.android","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.IvanKovalov.quadline.android&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.roasterygames.smartphonetycoon2":{"title":"Smartphone Tycoon 2","description":"Welcome to \xabSmartphone Tycoon 2\xbb!

Generally games have that many adds to try and force the play to pay to get rid of the adds or because they prefer add income over players. I truly love the game but between the bugs and the fact I can\'t play 3 mins, I need to uninstall..","Really good start but definitely needs some work. Every minute there is 3 back to back ads, also there is a few basic phone features that you have to pay for each individually. Settings menu doesn\'t work, phone creation interface is a bit glitchy at times. With some work could be a very good game.","Great concept but seems under developed for a couple reasons. 1. Many spelling and grammatical errors. I have no problem with grammar until it becomes too much. If you want to create a game for English speakers or one that translates to English please have an English speaker check it. 2. I can be successful without fans. Bad reviews don\'t hinder sales and that makes the game a little boring after the 2nd or 3rd phone. It\'s a great concept, but not a good execution. Just the same game as the 1st.","Kind of mediocre. You get research instantly and can\'t develop a new phone while waiting for sales to finish. The in-game rating system could be fixed. A few of the customization functions are locked behind separate payments, in other words you\'d have to purchase each of said options once. While I hate to be that guy, but the amount of ads are a little agitating. The UI could use with some performance improvements. Not a bad concept at all. But the game just doesn\'t work particularly well.","I love this game, but have one issue with it. All of the options are realistic and offer an experience I haven\'t seen much of from smartphone tycoons. My main issue is that you can\'t do more than 1 task at a time, or at least not that I have seen. While the employees are creating/researching one phone, I should be able to start on a new one to have available in queue."],"appId":"com.roasterygames.smartphonetycoon2","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.roasterygames.smartphonetycoon2&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.armorgames.sodadungeon2":{"title":"Soda Dungeon 2","description":"Your favorite fizzy dungeon crawler is back!

There\'s new characters, a new land to battle in, even new monsters. (by the way) the \\"Bone Witch\\" looks amazing like something out of a comic book.\ud83d\udc4d It\'s of course a bit more challenging now and takes a bit more time, still a lot of fun! One of if not the best Dungeon Crawler you\'ll find. I can\'t wait to get my hands on that wizard character. \ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udcaf","Great so far. I love the old school feel. Lots of incentive to play. Flaws, when leaving a dungeon, it says progress will be saved. After MOST ads, it\'s a blank screen and restart is required. My progress is NOT saved. This includes voluntary ads. A lot of time is wasted messing with this. I\'m a little too bitter to pay for no ads. I haven\'t had enough fun because of this","Fun just like the first one! The main problem is that the runs take a long time, even when skipping ahead levels. I wish there was a fast forward button. You may have to buy that for a lot of (in-game) money or buy a bundle for it, but you have to go through at least 4 prestiges, which equates to like 1000 levels. Happy it works offline!","This is one of the best idle games I\'ve played, and it\'s only optionally idle, the normal gameplay is good as well. My only problem is popup ads every once and a while after dungeon runs, but I can look past those to give this game 5 stars. The implementation of ads in every other way is fair and optional, and you can eventually buy the ability to get rid of ads with gold in the game.","I enjoyed it for a while, until things really slowed down and got very tedious. The inevitably long waits to get through the dungeon are really annoying, and boosting the speed doesn\'t do much to help. Also paid to remove ads from the game, but all that did was remove the tiny banner ad I had no problem with during battle. I was still bombarded with loads of ads for everything else though."],"appId":"com.armorgames.sodadungeon2","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.armorgames.sodadungeon2&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.outfit7.movingeye.swampattack":{"title":"Swamp Attack","description":"Your swamp is under attack!

I just wish that one of the weapons from the Challenge levels (the level where you are given a Revolver) became a main weapon you can use after clearing the respective challenge level (I think it was challenge 8). That way, you have a choice between the strong, but slow reloading, shotgun, or the quick reloading Revolver with less ammo. You can make the upgrades damage and reload speed, rather than larger clip.","It\'s honestly a fun game, but becomes incredibly difficult after only a little bit. The shotgun is too slow and doesn\'t seem to be faster or stronger after upgrading. The energy system is horrible. You get like 5 or 6 plays then you wait for a long time. The coin system sucks as well. You get less than a thousand coins for each match and it requires well over a couple thousand to upgrade or buy. The game is fun, but it\'s too difficult and has a horrible system.","Absolutely love this game and this is the second most interesting game that I have ever played so far after crazy penguin war\'s. I completed all the levels and was waiting for more updates but I don\'t know what happened as the game would freeze form time to time and I won\'t be able to play at all. So I reinstalled it for about four times but still then the game would freeze and the screen would turn Black.","Fun. But the lack of any kind of regular updates means you cant advance once you have beat all levels. And, when you upgrade, it is hard to tell any difference in the strength of weapons. The shotgun takes forever to load, even when it is fully upgraded. They have promised new levels for almost a year now. If you invest anything financially, the lack of updates and consideration of you, as a customer, is extremely disappointing.","Its a very entertaining game to play. But, my one gripe with the game is that when ever the double points option pops up, I go to select it and it just disappears as soon as I touch the screen and I lose out on doubling my points. Very annoying. Another thing, it takes way too long to upgrade your equipment. You never have enough coins to do so."],"appId":"com.outfit7.movingeye.swampattack","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.outfit7.movingeye.swampattack&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.SimpleMission.SwordofOath":{"title":"Sword of Oath - Roguelike Card","description":"Roguelike, card and RPG are fused to make this best single player deckbuilding game\\nCCG battles & adventure ahead\\n\\nFeatures:\\n- Summon and Upgrade Heroes and their Cards: \\n- Enemies differ each dungeon\\n- Dynamic Deck Building: Choose and use your card wisely\\n- Powerful Abilities Building: Artefacts and blessings can be purchased during the battle","descriptionHTML":"Roguelike, card and RPG are fused to make this best single player deckbuilding game<br>CCG battles &amp; adventure ahead<br><br>Features:<br>- Summon and Upgrade Heroes and their Cards: <br>- Enemies differ each dungeon<br>- Dynamic Deck Building: Choose and use your card wisely<br>- Powerful Abilities Building: Artefacts and blessings can be purchased during the battle","summary":"Build your deck, slay monsters, Invent your strategies, explore dark dungeons","installs":"500+","minInstalls":500,"maxInstalls":947,"score":0,"scoreText":"0.0","ratings":0,"reviews":0,"histogram":{"1":0,"2":0,"3":0,"4":0,"5":0},"price":0,"free":true,"currency":"USD","priceText":"Free","available":true,"offersIAP":true,"IAPRange":"$0.99 - $99.99 per item","androidVersion":"4.4","androidVersionText":"4.4","developer":"Dark Void","developerId":"Dark+Void","developerEmail":"darelldeckcard@gmail.com","developerWebsite":"https://discord.com/invite/s4dkmz37","developerAddress":"No 2, Unit 5, 13 Xuzhou Fifth Village","privacyPolicy":"https://sites.google.com/view/simple-mission/%E9%A6%96%E9%A1%B5","developerInternalID":"Dark+Void","genre":"Card","genreId":"GAME_CARD","icon":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/xtXn3Yu_OH-2A2frytKpp-L2p6S0M8lS2UNE0yCqbbR7NHNs0nqlCRrPt_slo0qHctqq","headerImage":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/94XzWyGdxM_pt2uQKKoosGFjXf3QXQMdKuD6BugBwqcBeUuFKUyhiG2ScDjw8KAyVac","screenshots":["https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/byJi3uXNNZTeUYbhLB8rhXLkf_BD5CVViw9l8ZWe-206leMmzpDjAoy2Ukel9uLQdHA","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/HO63CN52tqHcWpPDj3HUnfDoaz7z_8brtRHeP07Jc1odZ2eTcQDr6u_UUK0keNuDVQ","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/4lPRxlvtymvPmu4Ybpu4BPOBr8jnZcjKSrEqlNU0IXp7TrnFxUaKykOwKnH82dQDN8mO","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/gUJBfA5IDggV-9TVldP5AwGhEP9Ao4a77BEhBh2F5hAp7wy7q3e-RxRUbtUYcUcC0g","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/jo83AOmFluWfe9LvjJ0HLpyemI2SIioPr7myPUTTYi9jKJr0w2aUD2QQWpdsHUr2POXz","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/gcQQ5ZrFuz7IOrxR1fb3LgclpDWeypLU8vb-suJWIqqWLEk_7Gc4MXL0A4VfTNJqS8w","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/ujyXrfZHN25WCjsT57YFYpGOEpn9SnLHAaNMfEkU2JWgvo3E3MC3bqgaS8r5eI5LOmmM","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/EeJrJqINKwPhT0i1yT_4QzqRvIAplnohVfcGqm3MSvhddyx03IBQyZ2eLjDnY5Eubg","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/h2Nb7oYrtR7QmMNzb4qXEF-HPyxVOvqxzY6SxepytEf17hlF-AX01L165kKpCa77T3tI","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/1mSYxvf7XNgLD3D18X0sWf7eUtPJj5elxM_ulEV7CywH5ceRr9Sph8wB0eL0Rm2E1Lk","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/AiYFsOZGLip5-O3o53xvnOEZ1-A5vFnVsaQW5o12tVr_DsHvByiXAhFY8jTwjq_zfd8","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/fkJut-GJ0e_OWIuDJdAe8t6X5An6xastMy2Plsm1O-1M7wXdP-NvfgSztbmvC1R8oIk","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/NT7-dtSHCPWS-oyQyInPDonq36d0SdRmd7Fla6zrqQFQxxUcg3keU5DQbldNrwXK5jY","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/GxabXrcGDw4TfqYSMENuqGyIlpZ-2KRQrhEZwgvzohUebqWSqU8L74cPbFGwYDxONDM","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/9lWOrFXL6cxsLR7Dmj0ZPTxcjTN3UYyaHTZibtG4ZUl6QWhy-KqBnnxgbtxH1uljvt8","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/KyuUQPshW5JfG7JPxw1UtTBMSwMcrbYYlBDSr_dMdQZ0MoSpNpJTv96t4821xIsWRw","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/mxGgPVtSGB71pOcz3YogCdteNP2iM5QsUwNvo2HTvIKSd2WId1tThgU9J2ak73D_Hfmc","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/8rHs-MY5nzWmqMU5cfn2_Z70y1GBh2tBXvjsZLYUxgHph66NxxTfaNBozuAN62hMRek","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/r0Omu6-7XJj2VdofGv87SV9hp3LgnDA2LUEhrh_vYSqYrB4blXaAJ4c9LdM0OA65Og"],"contentRating":"Everyone","adSupported":true,"released":"Nov 4, 2021","updated":1649933692000,"version":"5.0","recentChanges":"Roguelike, card and RPG are fused to make this best deckbuilding game<br>CCG battles &amp; adventure ahead<br><br>Features:<br>- Summon and Upgrade Heroes and their Cards: <br>- Enemies differ each dungeon<br>- Dynamic Deck Building: Choose and use your card wisely<br>- Powerful Abilities Building: Artifacts and blessings can be purchased during the battle<br>-Parkour mode is full of challenges.<br>-Combo, strategy and luck, they are all you need to conquer the world!<br>-Story mode is added<br>-Hero Gallery is enabled","comments":["Is nice.because is offline with 3 campaign type ( mission Easy /Adventure hard/ endless void) ,the game is similar as..

Tap Busters has some of the coolest most unique graphics I\'ve ever seen, which adds to the addiction of getting new armor. I have only one complaint and that is evolutions. The game takes incredibly long to get back to your next evolution stage when you get up to the thousands. Other than that this game is a must have for any idle lovers.","It\'s a lot of fun, but at the end of the day, it\'s just another tap game. There\'s too much saturation of these types of games and it just gets old. You tap. Your character shoots. The enemy gets shot. You can upgrade over time with the money earned from tapping. You think this time it will be a different kind of tap hero, but you\'re going to be heavily disappointed. It\'s the same as all the others. Lack of creativity in storytelling. Great artwork though.","A really nice idle game, thought you still need to be quite active to get somewhere. Cool weapons and armor, a lot of customization options! A big plus is the \\"talent\\" feature on both skills and evolution points. The only thing that bugs me is the wait time between levels, please remove it for faster progression. Good work","Transitions between monsters and between levels are very slow. It made me feel like I don\'t even want to evolve/prestige \'cause of the time it took to get back to the level where I was before. Remove the extra waiting times so we can rush through the lower levels after we prestige.","Super slow game, very low and slow progress... I waste one week on it, I didn\'t even reach the 7th upgrade for my weapon, and every thing is expensive... and the gold drop per kill is so damn little. the game has good graphics indeed and a lot of good features, but it is slow and the boredom hits the player after finishing couple levels without making much money."],"appId":"com.metagamestudio.tapbusters","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.metagamestudio.tapbusters&hl=en&gl=us"},"sk.phx.terrarium":{"title":"Terrarium: Garden Idle","description":"Try the most relaxing crop idle game: discover, collect and grow lovely plants to increase your oxygen income and expand your garden!\\n\\nLet\u2019s relax in this chill and cute mobile/idle game.

I would consider paying to support the game and remove ads if it was less. Theres an ad every time a level up, every time I switch worlds, ect\'. Other than that this game is amazing and so fun to play!","I have played 3 weeks and unlocked all 3 terrariums. After a day of ads, I liked it enough to purchase the monthly sub but was disappointed with how little game there is. There needs to be more levels with weekly or biweekly events. More decorations you can earn, even without buffs, would be nice. I loved the game, the graphics and the gameplay but for where it is now, NOT worth $4.99/month or to put up with the ads, of which there were far too many.","The number and length of the ads on the non paid version are excruciating. Every 30 seconds or so, a red cardinal flies across the screen with a special envelope whose only purpose is to invite you to watch another ridiculously long ad to get more points. You can\'t access any of the cute ornaments and books for your terrarium without getting the paid version. Every time you level up you have to watch more ads that take ten tries to x out of.","I can\'t take care of actual plants for the life of me, so this app fulfills the plant wanting, without the actual plants. Although the concept is simple and even boring to some, I love this game. Has got to be my FAVORITE app on my phone and tablet. Everyone needs this app, it\'s really great to use in between studying or homework. I use it when I\'m stressed or overstimulated. It\'s fun to see yourself gain more plants and progress.","Every time you level up you are given 2 options regarding the bonus points you get. >Collect Or >Collect x3 (by watching a short ad) So my question is: WHY DO YOU SHOW AN AD NO MATTER WHICH ONE IS CHOSEN? WHAT IS THE POINT OF GIVING US AN OPTION IF YOURE JUST GONNA BOMBARD US WITH ADS ANYWAYS? It\'s obnoxious. EDIT: upon looking at other reviews this problem has been in place since 2018. Four years. I\'m prob uninstalling today, this is NOT RELAXING. Originally: 3 stars, but now? 1.

Optimize skill preset page.<br>3.Fixed the bug related to achievement rewards claiming.<br>4. Other bug fixes.","comments":["A cute idea but the game is clunky and needs some kinks worked out. I shouldn\'t be allowed to click out of the fairy chest if I don\'t want to watch an ad. I\'ve had to click multiple times because my clicks aren\'t registering. I was tricked into watching an ad because I was receiving rewards for achievements and the ad button suddenly popped up where the recieve button was. Ultimately not a good gameplay experience.","Pushing Ads On you. When the chest fly\'s across the screen and I touch it...it brings up money you can get if you view an ad but there\'s no way to click out of it at all. That\'s not right, I don\'t want to be forced to watch that ad. The only way to get it off your screen is to click it or close down your game by hitting your home button on the phone.","Unprompted ads. It\'s such a shame, the game seemed really fun. But the constant ads when upgrading gear really makes this game unplayable. If the unprompted ads would be removed, this would be a top notch game.","Its a simple yet nice idle games. Little bit a fun stories and done, back to afk. The progression is a bit slow (its a bit faster while idle since you can catch fairy box for ads rewards), end-game equips are really expensive while gold gains are small (you can buy gold with dimension frag, tho). The moment you stuck progressing, then its lvling > rebirth fiesta. Overall, the games are good for who love idle / login > check stuff > logout style. The ads are not bothering much, at least for me.","Game wasn\'t bad for a free idle game. So I bought the 14.99 2 free 5 click upgrade. It didn\'t work but my money was still take. So I logged in in the game did a cloud upload. Uninstaller and re installed the game only to find I can\'t download my cloud save and I have to pay the 14.99 again to get my upgrade."],"appId":"com.loongcheer.moke.pixelknight.idlerpg.adventure","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.loongcheer.moke.pixelknight.idlerpg.adventure&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.hg.townsmen7free":{"title":"Townsmen","description":"From humble backwater to medieval metropolis - build the city of YOUR dreams!\\n\\nDevelop your tiny village to a grand medieval empire with a thriving economy and happy villagers!

My one complaint would be the buildings don\'t change after being improved a level. It is enjoyable to watch the townsmen go about their daily lives and how theatrical some dialog can get in a few quests. This game isn\'t a blatant cash grab; which ironically makes it worth a lot of money.","The gameplay is solid, reminds you of age of discovery, the graphics are quaint in a good way, similar to a polished Stronghold, and unlike a few other mobile games, many of the cosmetics can be purchased for gold, not crowns (premium currency), which is good as they are required to keep citizens happy. However, perhaps this is my device, but I crash every 20-30 minutes, which in of itself isn\'t a big deal, except that it is paired with a low frequency of auto saves, losing upwards of 10 minutes","I\'d give it 5 stars, except for the fact it crashes a lot during the forced advert. Something is causing it to shut down when it\'ll attempt to start the count down time for an advert. Fix that issue for 5 stars. Thanks. Outside of that issue, I really enjoy the game. The adverts are bothersome, but ok. The banner at the top is the same. Fix the buggy issue and I have no problems.","this is one of the best simulation games ive played on mobile, if not the best. I love the weather effects, and that you can zoom in and hear townspeople and noises! my only complaint is that the people cry out for (herbs, hops, etc) and its right next to them. Other than that, this game is AWESOME! if the music could change with the season\'s, that would be wonderful, but nonetheless, the different scenarios are really fun too, thank you!","5 stars for the game. 0 star for the ridiculous amount of pop up ads. find a better way to deliver ads because every time i get on a roll, i get interrupted by another ad. I\'m not paying to get rid of ads if i feel forced to; lessen the volume of them and then i might, or just charge for the game itself. That\'s better than making it unplayable until we pay for the ad-free version."],"appId":"com.hg.townsmen7free","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hg.townsmen7free&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.DL.war.planes.inc.torpedo.bomber.fighter.aircraft.ww2":{"title":"Warplanes Inc.

But I do have some issues 1. There is a audio bug where the audio completed cuts out after an add plays 2. The flight controls are a little wonky but definitely are not so bad that it\'s unbearable 3. The in app purchase are steep but with that being said I think this game has 1 developer and you can tell they have a vision and do care about the game. Even though I have issues with the game I do completed recommend the game!","Dude I\'m dying of laughter, I keep changing reviews from good to bad, and bad to good, there\'s a funny bug I encountered on the 3rd plane I think, where I crashed into a plane, landed on the runway, and won the level, even though my plane got destroyed. I also agree with Shane Rogers, it is pretty strange how certain things aren\'t the selected language.","So far i like the game. But i think that it needs some work in the air defense mode. Anti-air guns takes a bit long to reload, it may be that im just not good but i cant get past 2:43mins in that game mode. I cant keep up against 10+ plus planes flying in my air space. Besides that, i think its an ok game. I like the graphics, simple and good.","One of the best games I\'ve played in a while! Very in depth and well put together! The flight mechanics are Farley realistic as well! Great job devs!!! After completing the campaign I am just completely amazed the amount of work put into the development of this game! The story is incredible and I am definitely stoked to play the other modes that were unlocked after I completed the Campaign! P.S. First game of its kind I\'ve come across that has replay value! Keep up the great work guys!","It\'s a cool game, with some nice physics and momentum going for it. It\'s a bit bothersome at times, since you don\'t fly very fast, so everytime you crash you gotta get back into the air again, and then try to blow up your adversaries with some fairly difficult (though fair) controls. It\'s not bad. If you want to play a decant game that doesn\'t constantly annoy you, then get this one."],"appId":"com.DL.war.planes.inc.torpedo.bomber.fighter.aircraft.ww2","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.DL.war.planes.inc.torpedo.bomber.fighter.aircraft.ww2&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.stereo7games.wwd":{"title":"World War Defense","description":"A free tower defense strategy game!

Too many errors and spelling mistakes. Edit:A new issue. Units get upgrades at certain thresholds, the first upgrade had a 15 min timer, it goes to 4 hours for the second upgrade, that\'s 32 hours for just active units.","Just hit level 100 with my characters. In order to break 99 to 100 you must pay 5 million coins, plus wait 8 hours for training for each character. or watch 8 ads at 30 seconds a piece. Terrible idea when I have a full roster of characters... Edit, also the reward for finishing a level is terrible, 180 thousand coins rewsrded for completing level 650, costs 2 million to level up a single character or module at the moment.","It starts off well, but after a few levels the ads cause the game to crash and I end up having to reset. It got annoying and I uninstalled after a day. This issue needs to be fixed for future players.","Honestly it\'s quite a good game. I just have a bit of criticism and that is the speed. It can go up to x2 speed but sometimes for grinding it\'s better if it could go faster. So a idea is give a mini menu that pops up when you click the speed and it has 1x 1.5x 2x 3x 4x 5x. But other than that I really like the game, it\'s fun to play when you have nothing to do all day. Edit* One more is while upgrading it can be annoying after afking to have to spam upgrade. So you hold for 3 seconds and it go","I recently accidently tapped the top left corner of my screen, giving me access to the dev console, in which I gave my self millions of gems coins xp and level, I\'m at the point where when I go to upgrade say my transport, the game gives me coins instead of the opposite.

First I don\'t mind the ad system. It\'s rewarding and mostly voluntary. The draw system is decent, but does have its flaws. Especially the golden keys and tracked Sims. Gathering 10 can be difficult and the return on that effort can be less than rewarding. This is a game for whales. It can cost alot if you wanna move up quickly.","This is a fun game, it truly is. My only issue with the way it operates is the progression speed of the game, it\'s truly just slow, dull, and boring in the sense that I could travel the actual United States faster than the completion rate of some of these levels. I recommend either decreasing the amount of levels you have to complete or decrease the 30 seconds per stage to 5-10 seconds because, even in the early game it takes forever just to around .75-1 level a day.","An excellent take on an idle game. You can choose to go offline, but it\'s far more rewarding if you stay by your team. It\'s also very well paced, as you can his pass a level by the skin of your teeth, and get a reward right after that would have helped you blow through that same level. Overall very fun, especially the stat increases. Speaking of stats, Albuquerque is insanely broken. Literally 5 of his skills are damage increases, and there\'s another 3 that a few of those piggyback on.","The game is entertaining, a fun way to spend a few minutes or an hour. Plenty of characters and weapons. My concern is similar to other reviewers that towns aren\'t consistent in that some are fairly easy to pass in a few days with occasional upgrading of the people while others require your complete and undistracted assistance with tapping to get anywhere past halfway. Also, the gold drop is inconsistent making it difficult if not impossible to upgrade your people in certain towns.","The game was great up until the recent update. They changed it so you almost never get any new characters sim cards, and removed all ways of getting silver tickets by replacing daily rewards with a lot less helpful items. Overall, it was a fun game and worth the time, but not any more. Don\'t waste your time until this is fixed, otherwise you will never get far."],"appId":"com.sonypicturestelevision.zombieland","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sonypicturestelevision.zombieland&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.pixelperfectdude.htdrive":{"title":"#DRIVE","description":"#DRIVE is an endless driving videogame inspired by road and action movies from 1970s.

Until, yall changed the UI, yall removed some maps, changed the way you unlock cars, and enter you made all those changes. I don\'t like the game anymore. It was perfect before but now it\'s just ruined. Don\'t think I\'ll be playing ever again unless we go back to the old version.","You have got to be kidding. The game was perfect the way it was! The new update completely changed the game in a horrible way. Instead of using caps for cars and upgrades, it\'s all just card packs, which is a bad system for most games including this one. Maps are removed, cars harder to get, body kits and colors special to cars are all removed. This was my favorite time killer but I guess I\'ve got to find another game that isn\'t ruined like this game. Can\'t recommend this game anymore.","The newest update has made a formerly fun game frustrating. Every car in my garage has lost its custom colors, and it\'s taken all of my in-game currency just to fix the ones in the \\"Mini\\" and \\"Basic\\" categories....with at four other categories to go. Also, the performance modifications are apparently gone, I can no longer track how far I\'ve driven each vehicle, and the new UI is endlessly confusing. I can no longer recommend this one.","While some things in the latest update were nice, they took to much away. I like the new ui, the garage (minus having to buy colors before seeing them), and the new map is great as always. However, the cards bring a frustrating rng that was just a chill grind. The removal of cars that I was saving up for was a heavy blow, as well as the ones still in the game being inaccessible. Removing maps drains the vibrant and diverse color this game had. Used to love this game, we\'ll see what happens next.","This is a very good quality game and I definitely recommend this. There is adds however and they do get annoying sontimes, but they are sort of rare. The controls are easy and the overall game I simple to master. There are really cool scenery places that are really good quality for most games. (Edit)- My rating has dropped down to 2 stars after the newest update. EVERYTHING has changed, including the main screen, and even how you get cars.

Sometimes the dialogs would be too repetitive, I think it could be good to increase the amount of time between thoughts. On some levels, the character can get hurt from enemy fire and even open lockers that are on the other side of a wall, maybe that\'s a bug? Anyways, Keep up the good work!","Once you start you can\'t put down. By far one of the best games I\'ve played to kill time. What\'s awesome its controller compatible as well. I used an xbox controller, wish the fire button was a trigger than a button but I\'m not here to complain. The story is great, the sound effects & music played along very well. And yes you can set the difficulty & boy what a rush it is. If you haven\'t played it yet I would highly recommend it. I have a Note 10+ & no issues whatsoever.","Pretty great game! The controls aren\'t too bad though combining interact and shoot is a little bit iffy. It makes sense to not have the extra button but determining if we\'re interacting with an object or shooting should be a little bit more refined. Besides that, I don\'t mind the ads between the levels and it\'s pretty fun! Good job creating this game!","I haven\'t played through the entire have yet but I enjoy the atmosphere and design. Its simple enough to play short rounds but complex enough to make me want to come back. Very few ads which is rare these days. I do wish the monologue/dialogue was easier to read, perhaps a screen where you can read a journal. I also think it would be beneficial if I could click and hold the weapon button to find the stats in the equipped weapon. Overall a fun play!","Pleasantly surprised. The game has a nostalgic feel to it, and props to the developer for making this good of a quality game on his own. It\'s difficult without being frustrating and there are enough guns to make gameplay diversive. Only complaints are reviving. I dont mind watching ads to revive, but enemies are shooting you the second you close out of the ad, giving you almost no time to react before most if not all of your health is gone again."],"appId":"com.BeardyBird.Ailment","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.BeardyBird.Ailment&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.pipkin.games.alchemy":{"title":"Alchemy: Forge of Gods","description":"Create new elements from six primary elements: air, earth, fire, water, darkness and light.

We prepare new mode for you! Test your imagination and mind!","comments":["I like how gameplay works with tabs. It\'s easy to go through every combo when you have a known element (and saves me from feeling like I PtW buying both hints...). On the other hand, I\'ve only had it for a week or so, and I\'ve nothing else to find. The elements found in certain categories don\'t make sense. Maybe because the categories aren\'t specifically named? Overall gave it a 4 because I see it\'s being updated as it goes. Staying hopeful for future updates and keeping the app for now.","Eh, it is decently fun. Some of the combinations make no logical sense, but whatever. The main problem is that it seems too easy to finish the game. Took two days of moderate play to complete and find all of the basic \\"elements\\". I don\'t imagine it will take too much longer to go through the collection combinations, especially the country ones.","I absolutely love the interface. I\'ve played a lot of alchemist games, and I\'ve always hated the chaos and confusion. This one fixes every problem I\'ve ever had with all the other games. It is very user friendly. Beautiful interface, organized tabs, and (BEST FEATURE EVER!) you can see your progress towards completion.","I really enjoy this game. I\'ve had fun trying to come up with correct combinations. The only thing I would like to see is a menu where I can touch an element and see what it was made from and what it can be used in to create. I figured out the red and blue flashes really fast, but I end up redoing several combos because I can\'t remember how I ended up getting some of the elements. Overall great game.","Disruptive and too many ads. Is this a game or an advertising show?! I have had this game on my mobile for awhile now, and I decided to try it out today...Big Huge Mistake. I had just started and not even a minute into the game, I watched more than 5 ads!

The game is awesome, but I have to give it a low rating because it is unplayable. The game needs to be calibrated for the touch screen system because certain actions can\'t be performed because the icons do not match with where the screen is being touched. It would have a 5-star rating, but I can\'t until this issue is addre. I would love to play through the series on mobile, but that is currently impossible. Please fix this. Thank you.","It\'s a good game and fun. I played it a second and a third time to see if different choices would actually take me to different areas of the game which it really didn\'t though. No matter what choices you made the game was still basically the exact same through the entire game. If they had like alternate endings or if your choices actually made major changes in a game would be cool too","How utterly disappointing. I enjoyed the trial chapter and was more than happy to purchase the season pass. Immediately into the second chapter, all of the subtitles and communication selections switched to German. There is no setting to change the language. I emailed their support about this issue, and received a response informing me that they no longer offer support for their games. Unfortunately, because it was an in app purchase, it is difficult to receive a refund. Dont chance it.","amazing game! always loved this style of game tbh. only problem I see is that you have to pay for episodes 2 & on. I remember they had a \\"season pass\\" for the console versions where you got to pay like $14.99, which is fine. but with the mobile, you gotta pay for each episode individually at $4.99 a piece. basically that\'s about $19.96 if you just do the 4 normal episodes, or $24.95 if you wanna do the extra \\"400 Days\\" episode.","I love this game so much, Season 1 is the best imo, but sometimes the language turns into Spanish, it happens randomly and I have to go back to the main menu and start the episode again for it to go back to English. Can you please fix this, I don\'t know what\'s causing it and I really don\'t like it. I have to restart from a savepoint multiple times because it keeps going back to Spanish."],"appId":"com.telltalegames.walkingdead100","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.telltalegames.walkingdead100&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.telltalegames.walkingdead200":{"title":"The Walking Dead: Season Two","description":"The Walking Dead: Season Two is a five-part (Episodes 2-5 can be purchased via in-app) game series that continues the story of Clementine, a young girl orphaned by the undead apocalypse.

Thought maybe it was a problem exclusive to that game & downloaded season 1 as well as season 2. Unfortunately this problem (glitch/bug) are present in every iteration of the walking dead games. Please fix this!!! It seems to be a common theme. Glad I didn\'t waste money on any of these.","Beautifully done game, nothing like all the other games out there. What separates it from other games on the play store is the well done storyline and gameplay; the graphics are simple, yet well done, comparable to that of the Borderlands series. Since it is an offline game, it runs very smoothly, and is great for lunch breaks, road trips, or any day of the week. Definitely worth the money.","love this series! love this style of game. only issue I see is having to pay for episodes 2 & on. the console versions allowed us to buy a \\"season pass\\" which basically allowed us to save a few bucks. with the mobile version you can\'t do that, you have to buy each one individually.","I love the first game, and this one adds more action than the other game. I can say the story is great the character\'s are loveable, and graphics are better than the last game. You get to play as clementine which is the best thing about, and she\'s not all nice and that any more. I rated it 4 stars because the action parts.

Some of the audio quality is very poor, and it\'s made more noticable in contrast to the music, which is very high quality. The characters look very blank, and in a character-focused game, that\'s going to make it less believable when they emote. The animations (faces especially) are stiff and robotic, and hard to engage with. The PC version of season one had that last problem, but it\'s exacerbated by the transition.","Compared to the first 2 seasons, this one definitely does not meet the standards. The first 2 seasons played smoothly with little lag, this one, well it moves in 2 speeds....SLOW and STOP! What a complete and utter waste of time. The amount of memory this game consumes is ridiculous. Only goes to show, when you get greedy and combine episodes together for purchase, only bad this can happen. Download this at your own risk, you\'ll never get to finish it.","I\'d enjoy the game more if it didn\'t lag all the time and crash every few minutes. I bought season two and it went perfectly, no crashes or lagging but this one is. Pls fix it. I have been a fan of this series since the first demo of season 1. I\'d like to continue to enjoy playing but this issue has to be resolved. Thanks. Edit: I\'m stuck in episode 2 because not only is the game slow but also it crashes a lot. It crashed like 5 times this is ridicules I\'m done. Too bad I cant get my money back.","Story is always a good one, but I\'ve never played a game that lags so bad to the point you can\'t interact with any button or to the point where it takes 5 minutes to finish sentence before the next person does. Wanted to purchase the season but there is no way I\'ll be able to until the lag is fixed which I\'m highly certain it wont be.","So upset. I have played the first 2 and was hooked. But when 3 came out I couldnt get it on My phone. So when I got a new phone it still wasnt compatable. Here we are on a 3rd phone i was excited to see it in the app store again after waiting so long. Only problem is the game play is awful. Lags. Jumpy and words dont match. I can live with that but in action scenes the screen doesnt respond and i die. Cant get any further!."],"appId":"com.telltalegames.walkingdead300","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.telltalegames.walkingdead300&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.FDGEntertainment.redball4.gp":{"title":"Red Ball 4","description":"Red Alert! \\nEvil minions want to squeeze the planet into a square shape.\\n \\nWho\'s got the balls to save the world ?

The old version you didn\'t have to wait 18:00 minutes to get 1 life but now you do. It makes the game alot harder to enjoy and experience. And you need to pay for all the levels unlock. The ad problem with most games isn\'t much here so that\'s decent at least. Not to many changes from the old version if you\'re revisiting the game but if you\'re newer you won\'t see much of a difference. But except for the life problem, it\'s a good game.","A very addictive game. I would recommend for users. There is only one problem, you have to wait for lives. It brings the game out of wack, and makes it harder to injoy. I recommend to take it off. Also no adds and unlimited lives, I get that but, all levels unlocked, you think it is a bit much? Please re-think the game, other than that it is amazing! These problems fixed, it will make it better, trust me. Edit: when you get to level 60 (3 boss hearts) it is CRAZY how hard it is, please fix it!!!","Very good game. Simple story and gameplay, challenging enough, kid friendly, and it doesn\'t make you watch ads unless you need a refill on lives. Also if you complete the game, you can play the levels again but time limited, try to unlock all achievements, etc. The reason i rated it only four stars is that in some levels it can easily turn into a rage game, especially when you can\'t go to the next world until you complete the boss level.","Ok, this is a nice game. Fell in love with it and looked forward to playing every new level. However, I was able to complete all levels with gold stars, rescued the female ball and then nothing. The rescue video was lacking, there was no real excitement after the game was finished. I was hoping to see Red Ball 5 with new episodes pop up. I was just left up in the air. Even went back to play over the old levels to see if I missed something. Good game, but need more excitement at the finish","The game is fun and all, but it takes so long to restore lives, plus on the speed running levels there are some that you litteraly can\'t get gold on because it\'s impossible! (Trust me, I\'ve tried). To add to all this the controls take forever to respond back. For example when I\'m moving and I want to turn back it doesn\'t turn for a while and instead makes my stay still for a long time."],"appId":"com.FDGEntertainment.redball4.gp","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.FDGEntertainment.redball4.gp&hl=en&gl=us"},"air.com.FDGEntertainment.Lonewolf.gp":{"title":"LONEWOLF (17+) - a Sniper Story","description":"17+ NOT SUITABLE FOR CHILDREN!\\nLONEWOLF is an intense game with moral conflicts.\\n\\n1 Minute: Your mental-noise has calmed down.

Sometimes when you shoot your aim randomly glitches so you miss the target and fail the mission which wouldn\'t be a big deal if you could just restart but you can\'t since you will need to wait a few minutes for a timer. Also there are so many ads it\'s frustrating. Definitely a \\"pay to win\\" type game or at least a \\"pay to make it an enjoyable game\\"","This game recommends using headphones, and so do I. It makes it a more immersive experience. It has a interactive graphic-novel sort of feel to it. It has a minimal amount of ads, but most of them can be skipped immediately(and you\'ll Still Get The Bonus). A lot of the guns (sniper rifles, pistols and assault rifles)and accessories(scopes, stocks, camo, etc.)are locked as Premium Content...but only $1.99 unlocks ALL Of It. \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50, all around, a great game if you like sniper games or a good story.","Smooth and intuitive controls, snappy and satisfying shots, great art style. I love it. My only gripe with this game is the \\"limited energy\\" system. It sucks having to wait for the energy, in this case called \'bullets\', to refill to select a new mission. I prefer spending a bullet every time I fail a mission instead. TL;DR: Good game, limited by having to wait to play again."],"appId":"air.com.FDGEntertainment.Lonewolf.gp","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.com.FDGEntertainment.Lonewolf.gp&hl=en&gl=us"},"air.com.FDGEntertainment.BloodyHarry":{"title":"Bloody Harry","description":"Join \\"Bloody Harry\\" on his hunt for vegetable-zombies! \\n\\nThere\'s a neverending supply of Weapons, Ammo and reasons to chop, smash and shoot them into pieces.\\nWhile you fight your way through the hordes of foul creatures, you\'ll eventually climb the career ladder in the global highscore list.\\n\\nYou\'ll also run into giant boss-zombies which may eat all your ammo before they finally make a return as harmless dessert.

It was a Flash game where you killed zombies while running from left to right. on that game you got weapon pickups in the middle of the level but I haven\'t seen that happen on this one yet. Hopefully though if It was not already implemented into the game they add It at a later date.","Addicting fun game. a few frustrating things about the game : 1. the enemies should insta die after completing the wave not after grabbing the crown , if you beat the wave and an enemy kills you before grabbing the crown, you will restart. 2. the survival mode needs a seperate experience menu to farm for new items or upgrades. 3. more skills and upgrades , guns , companions. this game has alot of potential its super fun. i wish coop or team up can be a thing in the future. 2 friends playn","I would give it 5, but my main issue here is when you get an achievement from google play, it doesn\'t allow you to use any of the controls until the achievement bar goes away, but that\'s not the worst part. The game the continues in the background while you just sit and watch your character defencelessly as he gets torn to shreds. Fix this issue and you\'ll get the last star I think you guys deserve","Getting coins is slow, makes for long, draining, replays of the same level and then dying repeatedly. I don\'t get missions for XP after a while, so leveling up and getting perks is way too slow. Where you stop for a second after getting hit isn\'t desirable, and enemies need lower health, just pickle dogs and meatball guys that stun you. Lower the regular enemies during boss fights. Death penalty on coins should be 25% or at least lower than 50%. Aiming joystick for switching directions?","The game is absolutely perfect. Great time killer, easy to upgrade, no pay to progress or anything like that. It\'s like the perfect mobile game you would want. The only thing I will complain about is in survival mode it isn\'t really exciting. I would also love a sequel, and the tomato fruit/veggie needs to be nerfeded too"],"appId":"air.com.FDGEntertainment.BloodyHarry","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.com.FDGEntertainment.BloodyHarry&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.FDGEntertainment.Oceanhorn.gp":{"title":"Oceanhorn \u2122","description":"You wake up and find a letter from your father.

My only issue is I could not play this game without attaching a controller. On the mobile version there were tasks that were just too difficult. The mobile version doesn\'t give you the ability to dash, doesn\'t provide the broken compass and doesn\'t give the same store option as on the PS4 or steam platform.","Nice little story. I wish I could go further. The controls were very difficult to deal with. It is easy to fall into a spike trap or to miss a shot when sailing due to the sensitive controls.

Good player controlls and equipment drops are just right to proceed in the game. When you die the severe penalty of losing so much experience takes away from the game, but that\'s probably just me because I really like to explore in these rpg games and it\'s not worth it when you lose so much. I tried at first but got cornered and overwhelmed so many times I had to stop or I would never be able to level up.","Great game! Very fun, detailed, and nice visuals. I felt inclined to purchase as soon as I hit the first town. The only issue the amount of text/dialogue errors. The sentence structure and actual wording is a bit all over the place, with dialogue often sounding strange, or not making much sense. You can still understand most of the text/dialogue, but some can be pretty hard to decipher, still perfectly playable. Other than that the game is amazing... a real, FULL game, with actual challenge!","Excellent The game can be brutal but in the end your character becomes god like and it is very fun. It takes awhile to get good at combat since this is not an easy going walk in the park kind of system. There is a ton of quests and character abilities to keep it interesting. Lots of upgrades for the gear too. The game was a lot longer than I was expecting, it took me 20 hours to complete it. Unbelievably good for the price of 5 bucks to remove the ads.","It\'s a really good game. As others have said sometimes enemies are hard to see, but that\'s about the only gripe. Have not finished the storyline yet only because I dont want to run out of missions. Everything is attainable for free. Nothing feels forced. And for young adults that game, it is uncommon games operate this way. I will say that if internet is off you can play without ads(something you can fix to make ur ad counts higher). Just figured I\'d throw that out there for your next update. 5*","I wanted to like it but after clearing the first \\"chapter\\" I just kept encountering the same game breaking imbalances. It became more frustrating than fun. It has lots of potential but sadly too much imbalance in leveling vs challenge. Maxing out at current level and moving on to the next area has a gap that impedes progress and ruins the flow. Really wanted to like it but it won\'t let me."],"appId":"com.GearStudio.AlmoraDarkosen","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.GearStudio.AlmoraDarkosen&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.FDGEntertainment.SuperCatBros.gp":{"title":"Super Cat Bros","description":"Six cats are the new Jump\'n\'Fur stars!\\n \\nReunite Alex the Cat with his siblings and explore a mysterious island. \\n \\nControl 24 paws with just 2 thumbs tapping the left or right side of the screen.

The controls here were very responsive and the using each of the cats abilities were super fun as well. The only issue I had was with the game\'s screen size. The screen didn\'t really fit on my device and I even set it to full screen but that didn\'t help. It was definitely an issue with a few of the game\'s stages. Maybe a future minor update will fix that issue someday. (Also, remove the extra 2 cat slots when choosing a cat. It doesn\'t really matter here.)","I\'ve been having a super fun time with Super Cat Bros! The game\'s got unique, intuitive, and easily customizable controls, the art\'s adorable and fun, and it\'s all in all a neat game I\'d reccomend! My only cons are that the heart system seems a bit arbitrary (though, not too obtrusive), and the screen scaling seems to be a bit off for my phone, which makes certain things a little harder. I totally suggest you check it out, it really is unique and fun!","IF YOU HAVE AN S22 ULTRA READ MY REVIEW. So I use to have an a52 5g galaxy. Well I recently upgraded to the s22 ultra and noticed that the screen was WAY off. I figured out a way around it to where the game is still playable. Go to the settings and type in full screen apps in the search (your phone settings), when you get there, there is a place to change the camera cut our. Have it show the camera cut out. Makes the game go back to normal view but not 100% perfect, still playable.","It seems like fun, and what i can see is cute and colorful, but the way it has nearly a quarter or more the screen missing makes this damn near unplayable. Having seen another post from a Samsung user with a similar issue, i tried to fix it manually via my settings. Turns out Google phones lack that same workaround. Please fix this promptly as i would really like to play!","Three things I\'m gonna complain about. \u2022 It glitches when I use the golden bat when there\'s a lot of coins to collect and it makes me die. \u2022 Don\'t you want us to play the game more so why have a life count on it? Plus some of the levels are really hard so the life hearts are unfair in my opinion. \u2022 For some screens, It doesn\'t fit all the way and you can\'t see the pause button or other stuff.

The only ads that you will ever watch are optional and will reward you with a pretty decent chunk of in-game currency. My only issue with the game is as you expand your farm with more crops and vehicles, it can be overwhelming to manage. This isn\'t a huge issue however, and if you\'re looking for a good free farm sim, you\'ve definitely found it.","Great game, has a few minor glitches. I\'ve had it for a year and just today had weird thing happen, i unloaded my combine off the semi trailer right next to a fence and it automatically put the header back on but inside the fence, so it\'s permanently stuck there and I\'m going to have to buy a new header\ud83d\ude02 It\'s really more funny than anything so just don\'t unload stuff close to a fence\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02","Decent graphics. The AI drivers need to be reprogrammed to not run into trees and buildings, and make the right course corrections to continue with assigned task. Needs to have fixed view modes so that the screen view doesn\'t turn when trying to turn the vehicle on the mobile version. Also need to be able to send a vehicle to a field to perform a task with the attached equipment.","This game is so simple yet so addicting. You don\'t have to pay to win which is rare for a free game, and you don\'t get overloaded with ads, you just have the option to get $25,000 to watch a video. I enjoy the options for different machinery, the forestry equipment was an exciting addition. My only real complaint is that some of the fields have buildings or other obstacles that are too close. When you hire someone to drive a machine, they crash into objects pole barns and buildings, or the fields are so close together that if you are plowing one field and have crops in one next to it, the plow will cross into the next field and take a chunk out of your crops when you turn to start your next row. Overall the game is fun, I can get sucked into it for hours.","A lovely little farming sim. Runs perfectly on my phone. Works with a controller and it\'s multiplayer. Long time fan of the series. Feature idea, and the reason I didn\'t give it all 5 stars. The tractors should have a \\"home\\" location you can set and then instruct them to go to. Similar to how they can be told to go to the mill or wherever. It\'s a real pain to have to take the time to bring them back from a mission you sent them on, or back from somewhere the AI got lost."],"appId":"com.giantssoftware.fs16","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.giantssoftware.fs16&hl=en&gl=us"},"air.com.lunime.gacharesort":{"title":"Gacha Resort","description":"\u2605 Hit the Beach in Gacha Resort! \u2605\\n\\nThe ultimate summer beach vacation app!

But other than that I would say it\'s good if your very bored \ud83d\ude2c","Let\'s talk Gacha Resort. Its an (almost) perfect time-passer, It does not have many bugs and is pretty much a full-on game for when you\'re bored. My only problem is that its not very enjoyable and even though it can help boredom, if you play for more than 5 minutes, you are most likely to get more bored. When it comes to the terms of recommendations, I would recommend it for a quick 5 minute round every other day.","Perfect game I always wanted a game like this but there are some issues like when I watch a add for gems when I was waiting for the add to come because the reward already was given but the add didn\'t come but just as I exited the add them BG music was playing 2 times when I closed the app the music was still playing so I wish it is fixed all the way it\'s AMAZING\ud83d\udc9e\ud83e\udd17","This game is fun and the drawings are really amazing! I know this might not be possible, but it would be great if every single unit/character could have a full anime drawing. Aside from that, the levels were easy to beat at first but I\'m at chapter two of the story playing on easy mode and u cant beat the stupid ducks even though my team has 2 6 stars and 3 5 stars.","The game is awesome and makes me less play Roblox, i have an idea for the game 1. Make it so players can have their own character and create scenes like Gacha World 2. Unlock pets by leveling up and playing minigames, and 3. Create dimensions that players can go to. But there\'s only one problem, when i go to the first minigame, it says it\'s easy but when i go into it the waves are too fast, so please fix that."],"appId":"air.com.lunime.gacharesort","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.com.lunime.gacharesort&hl=en&gl=us"},"air.com.lunimobi.animegacha":{"title":"Anime Gacha!

Also, you should have more stats to upgrade, literally just you can do like health and attack. I just want a little bit more for stats and characters, then I\'ll raise my rating. I do love this game, and I have 1 last idea. Maybe, like with gacha life, you could have minigames. But different minigames, because having the same minigames would be repetitive and boring. Thats it! I love this game. \u2764","I love this game! It\'s very addictive and I love how the spins are free! I just wish it was easier to see your player stats and upgrade your heroes without pressing on a button in the main menu all the time :) One thing I want to point out is that the leaderboards don\'t work and judging by the reviews of this game, haven\'t been working for nearly 4 years now. So it would be great if the devs could fix it but it doesn\'t really matter too much.","Loving it so far! Only been playimg a week or so. Unlocked all the characters. I hope they add more gacha case characters, to collect, soon. The events are quite hard, but ah well, just means i\'ve got to grind harder to progress, so it\'s a nice challenge. Only bug is with Leaderboards and Achievements, as neirher will load properly, so i cant see them. No biggy though. I have played all the developers games, except Resort, and this one is by far my favourite so far.","amazing. yes, amazing but I would like to add a suggestion for the super rares, the rainbow ones. I want to create like a cool scene of them fighting enemies, and then you get it. just like cookie run kingdom. :) but overall, amazing game!","I reinstalled this recently and i noticed not much had changed yet i still have fun. I was hoping to have seen some new cases after all these years but no change but still its fun. The only problem i have is i just want the gold and rainbow capsules be a little easier to get. Its very hard to level them up.

It\'s very simple and something I find myself coming back to a lot (not super common for me). Very generous with gems and gacha. The only complaint I have is that when you spin character\'s spinners, the controls are sort of weird? It\'s a mixture between a swipe and a tap. Overall an adorable, enjoyable time-waster!","THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER!!! when I first got the game it looked hard but I now got the hang of it and you win very cute and nice characters and you get fidget spinners that you can spin and I am very good at fighting because you don\'t need to tap anything to fight and I love the graphics because they are very nice for my opinion and I love completing a stage to get more diomand to get more characters in stages! I recommend this game! Download it now! \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d","Similar to other Lunime games. Fun with cute characters and the spinners are pretty cool. I expected there to be a little more to it, but it\'s nonetheless addictive. Add free version is worth every penny and I\'m happy to support the creator.","Love the game its fun and creative at the same time and the designs are awesome to only problem I have is sometimes when I battle the screen freaks out and turns black then comes back on after a minute other then that I give this game a 10 out of 10","I love this game!! So cute and realistic!! I love to play fidget spinners for 3 years and the game was not lagging, Good graphics, Great experience, Beautiful fidget spinners and characters, developed game very nice... Yep I love it so much I would hide it from my mother because she always deletes my games... \ud83d\ude1cYou should give it a try pals or should I say anime fidget spinner lovers\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d"],"appId":"air.com.lunime.animefidgetspinner","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.com.lunime.animefidgetspinner&hl=en&gl=us"},"air.com.lunime.nekogacha":{"title":"Neko Gacha - Cat Collector","description":"\u2605 Collect Cute Cats in Neko Gacha!! \u2605\\n\\nCreate your own Neko team of unique, fun-shaped kittens and Gacha for rare 6\u2605 Nekos!

Great for a cute little time killer, though. Heavy reliance upon RNG based mechanics can make the minigames a little frustrating, and I\'m having some issues getting a neko team strong enough to progress through quests too (because levels are based strictly on gacha draws which are also random). Otherwise? Great experience.","This game is great! It has many adorable nekos to collect. It has an awesome concept, too! I love the gem currency, so saint change that. Although, when I get to world 6 for questing, it is hard. Even with a whole team of 6 star nekos, I can\'t beat the first one. Also, the controls for the mini games are a bit hard to control. Maybe because the neko fever loads a bit slow idk. Other than that, this game is addicting and amazing.","This game is great! Only played for 1 day and I got 6 of the 6 star cats! They are also super cute and it\'s a very simple and easy game to play. I especially love the fact that you can collect different cats and they have a specific star and it means about their strengths and their heath. What\'s good about their health is that the higher it is the more chance that you can defeat the enemy in a quest! I think everyone should give this amazing game a try!!","It\'s great as far as gacha games go, with an extremely merciful drop rate. I\'ve only been playing for one day and I only need two more cats to complete the 165. The power rates are pretty unbalanced, so you end up only using the 6* cats but that\'s to be expected. The minigames are pretty hard and the quests are repetitive but that\'s about it.","a good game, timekiller or not. the only issue i have, while it\'s probably an issue with my device, is when i watch an ad fully, a bunch of things turn into black squares until i exit the game and open it up again."],"appId":"air.com.lunime.nekogacha","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.com.lunime.nekogacha&hl=en&gl=us"},"air.com.lunime.gachalife":{"title":"Gacha Life","description":"\u2605 Welcome to Gacha Life \u2605\\nAre you ready to start a new adventure?

Where you can create characters and customize them! The two things wrong are the ads. TOO MUCH ADS!! I understand that it has ads, but there are too many! Almost every 30 seconds and ad pops up! It really bothers me, and many other people too. The second thing is the LAGS. The lags are just annoying! For example: \\"I am making a new character, but then I start to LAG! I get out of the app and rejoin, but the character I was working on is..GONE. FOREVER.\\"","Great game, love the customization and the characters are adorable! Compared to the newer game it\'s okay but the game alone is amazing! I would definitely Dowland to pass some time and even make your own stories. But I do have one problem, there are WAY to many ads, I can only go to edit/home and studio two times at LEAST, before I get an ad. If you don\'t mind ads though this game is 5 stars!\ud83d\udc4d","I really love this. It\'s great to use for drawing practice and you can customize your character. The issue is the clothing options, certain face accessories, eyes, and head sizes are limited for android. It prevents it from making it more realistic and only iphone can keep everything. It\'s a struggle and a bit annoying. Otherwise, it would be cool for new things to come in soon. Maybe some new clothes or poses.","This game is honestly amazing. All the hairs, eyes, colors, clothes, everything! And, super impressed with all the videos and such. But, the only reason I didn\'t give it 5 stars is because I lag sometimes in the game. And, it makes my screen black and when I rejoin, it deletes the character I was working on, and I have to start over. Oh, and because of something called \\"gacha heat\\" Dont search it up, trust me. The ads are fine. But, I really like the game. Nice job! Totally reccomend this game.","I like the game it\'s really relaxing and really helps me get to Express my creativity, but there are a few things that I would change... For example, I\'m kinda bugged that they took away some of the features of the game also one thing that I\'d LOVE too see is a like option to turn off the music! That would make the game experience like 100000% better!! (I believe) but overall I really like this game and the community is wonderful!!"],"appId":"air.com.lunime.gachalife","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.com.lunime.gachalife&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.superluckycasino.epicjackpot.slots.vegas.android.free":{"title":"Epic Jackpot Slots Games Spin","description":"Play Epic Jackpot Slot Games Free Offline and get real Las Vegas style slots wins! \\n\\nTry over 40+ FREE Slot Machines with bonus games unlocked NOW with Epic Jackpot Slots Casino! \\n\\nFEATURES: \\n- Get 100,000,000 Bonus Coins free when you install Epic Jackpot Casino!\\n- Spin the bonus wheel for more free slot game coins every day!\\n- Over 40 different game themes, just like the floor of a real Vegas Casino in an android app! \\n- Play realistic casino slot machines without wifi - online or offline!\\n- Win EPIC Jackpots and Bonus games on every slot machine, way over A BILLION!\\n- Play against other players from around the world, can you win more for your league team?\\n\\nWant the best free slot games with bonus features and free coins?

It all depends on where the spins land that makes or breaks the competition. Where the spins stop is beyond my control. But, the rewards are great. This game is so addictive!","it\'s ok. the streaks are unrealistic. you get a crazy winning g streak followed by a crazy losing streak, there is no happy medium. when on the losing streak nothing will save you. you can switch slots, wait it out, uninstall/reinstall it doesnt matter so I recommend not buying anything when you are on one and you can definitely tell. I will get a response that its random and a game of chance but go to a casino and play for a while and see the major difference in how things go","I\'ve had fun while playing. But I\'d like to see some upto date slots like slingo. Maybe less ads. Need to fix bonus wheel I always get the same amount when I spin. It seems like now the slots are harder to play, when you get a bonus if you get a bonus they don\'t pay as much if at all. Might stop playing I\'m running out to fast. Just a thought to let you know about game play. Thanks.","I have always liked this game. But its got to where the games will not load. When i try to load them, the screen turns white, and the game reloads. This constantly happens. Support did I didn\'t have enough memory, so I moved it over to my SD card, and the same thing happens. I can\'t even contact support anymore. When I click on that option, the game reloads then, too. I\'ve uninstalled and reinstalled the game, cleared the Cache. Cleared the data, everything, and nothing works.","I did rate this app 5 stars before, because it was a fun game. I kept getting big wins where I would get more \\"coins\\" to keep playing. I hit a losing streak and lost all my coins. The app wants me to buy more, which I am not going to do. I have to watch videos to gain more coins to play, which I lose quickly.

Not sure if it\'s the game itself or androids but there is tons of glitches and it seems to have a great amount of ads.. long ads.. if it wasn\'t for those particular flaws , the game would be perfect with 5 stars . Other than that , it\'s only fun for that first few hours .","Rating changed 5 to Very fun especially when you join a team. Daily bonuses and easy to play. I love the game even more had a problem and they went out of their way to fix it. If I could give it 10 stars for customers service I would. Update: once i started paying for coins it seem as though I can\'t win. Also The bonus wheel barely gives me anything. I also noticed when the game starts spinning fast it guaranteed you aren\'t going to win. I guess they are trying to make us purchase more coins.","Just like all the others, start off great then lose it all in a matter of minutes. Get free spins and don\'t even win your bet back, bonuses suck, level up sucks, jackpots are virtually no existent. The graphics are great but that\'s it. The game is to tight with winnings. Over all, this game SUCKS and isn\'t worth the download and an ad pops up while the wheels are spinning. Poorly designed..","I\'ve played a lot of other slot games, this is by far one of the best. Others you lose your free coins before you could even get to a decent level. This one is amazing, you even can get coins on the load screen. I do not mind spending money in an app that isn\'t rigged so hard, like jackpot mania or jackpot fever, jackpot planet ect. You want a game that you can actually play for awhile on free coins, this is it.","I would have left a five star rating except for the constant bombardment of ads.

There\'s many different games to play, so u never get bored. The payouts are consistent and every now and then, you hit a huge one! The ads are there, but not to the point of feeling dumped upon. There\'s also several ways to get bonus coins without watching ads. You can join a group or play alone. The graphics are pretty good. I would recommend this!","It started out good, then BAM! Ad after Ad after Ad. Yeah, I know you\'re going to give your spiel about being a small company and needing ads for revenue, but there are better ways of doing ads. Having them take up space above the machines is annoying and who knows what kind of adware/malware comes with said ads. I\'m not going to be coerced into spending money just to get rid of them. Also, some ads are inappropriate. So not impressed with your tactics and apparently many others are not as well","It starts out great,lots of fun, and I was winning alot.Then they started to change my favorite games,more hurdles,less winning. The amount needed to get league points jumped from 10,000,to 12,500 $ won. The help I complained to was indignant, at best,claiming that \\"It\'s was just my luck\\"..& the ads are overwhelming. Real underhanded stuff to deal with,ALL THE TIME, I WOULD DEFINITELY NOT RECOMMEND!","The ads have gotten quite bothersome. There\'s an ad banner above my game taking too much screen area. Several times now, ads have cost me tournament placement by mysteriously popping up randomly at the end of the tournament and stopping my game. The payouts are extremely low and the bonus rounds are futile. Out of 8 bonus spins I received zero rewards!!! Please fix the ads!!! I really enjoy the game and hope this is fixed so I can continue to so.","I ran out of free coins after a few hours of playing. If you want people to continue playing we have to win. I have no problem clicking on ads or watching videos to make you money. I\'m out of coins so I\'m uninstalling and finding a new app to play. so no more money making clicks from me anymore.

The biggest issue for me is the energy system. Only 4 games for standard maps before running out of energy? If you the developers insist on keeping the energy system, please at least make it to where we the players can watch an ad to \\"refresh\\" energy to max, and have the ability to do so a few (2-3?) times each day. We\'d get more play time and you\'d get income from the ad watches, since most players are going to want to refresh their energy I assure!","Decent game no players online so it is pretty much solo. Difficulty is fair but the grind is unnecessary especially by yourself. First u have to grind each level the quests and the experience to get enough damage to clear the bosses and mobs. Characters should be avaible to pick one u would like from beginning because it is tedious to have to level them all and you\'ll definitely need their levels higher the further you go. Overall I like the concept but pretty poor execution on ads and leveling","So, I bought the pass, only to realize it only stops ads for djinns. The gameplay is amazing but the energy is too little and takes WAAAY too long too recharge. They want too much money for in game purchases that literally can\'t upgrade you unless you spend at LEAST 9.99. Second chance does nothing too save you, and if I could get a refund, I would. But it\'s google so I\'m not even going too try. Enjoy my 5 bucks. Lots of potential, killed by greed. As usual.","I love the open world dungeons rather than countless small rooms. These energy systems need to go, there should be zero games made with this archaic and aggravating system. It needs more of pretty much everything, gear, progression paths, differentiating characters on more than just a couple skills and minor stats.","This game sucks, seems fun at first and easy enough until you get to the third area and all the enemies kill you on two hits and there are at least 20 attacking at once. On top of that, some of the abilities don\'t work, like the second chance, I had it, went down and it didn\'t activate when it was only my first time dying. This game has so much potential to be fun but it\'s just too buggy."],"appId":"manastorm.spacehorse","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=manastorm.spacehorse&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.FDGEntertainment.CoverOrange1.gp":{"title":"Cover Orange","description":"The long awaited hit now on Google Play!

Kills time. Only one problem... I\'m not very far yet but level 1-36 is a bug or mistake. No matter what you do in the level, it fails. Looked up how to do the level and it told me to do the exact thing I had already done multiple times and it still fails. Only way to pass it is to use the pass(helmets)","Great game! This game requires you to use your brain right from the first level! There are no \'super-easy, no thought required\' levels. You must use logic and strategy to pass each fun level. The graphics are awesome and adorable.","I don\'t believe so many great reviews. Its just so slow and uninteresting. You cover an orange from an oncoming rain cloud, who seems to take an eternity to come so the round can end once you put the pieces in place. Its just not good imo, but it\'s too much logic and puzzle ability involved for those young enough for this sort of thing","I loved the game but uninstalled because I\'m extremely offended by the continuous pop up ads for games that are sexist and extremely offensive to women. When you clean up the ads, I\'ll reinstall.","overall it\'s a really cute concept, however it\'s too freaking slow! there\'s no speed up button once you get the all the oranges covered it\'s not like you can even move anything after you cover all the oranges so why does it go so slow and why do you have to have watch the cloud go all the way over if you got it done is done get the damn level out of the way"],"appId":"com.FDGEntertainment.CoverOrange1.gp","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.FDGEntertainment.CoverOrange1.gp&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.FDGEntertainment.CoverOrange2.gp":{"title":"Cover Orange: Journey","description":"THE ORIGINAL!

If you have ever deleted a game because it got to a level you just couldn\'t beat, then you should download this app. I was impressed with the graphics and the dynamics and how overall how entertaining it was. Waiting eagerly for the next update.","As free mobile games go this is fun. It is clearly derivative of the DKC series, especially Retro\'s games, but is this really bad thing? When we haven\'t had a new DK game in so long I\'m not complaining! The art direction is good and the level design, although quite short, can offer some interesting challenges. One thing I will say about the level design however is that it could do with having more varied action. It would have been nice to have seen more vine surfing and other varied sections","The music is phenomenal, the graphics are stunning, and the levels are very creative. My only complaint is about the game stealing coins from me. I refused to go to on the next level without all three coins, and even after finishing the game I had to return to previous levels to reclaim 2-3 coins! Solid 4/5.","First level too frustrating for beginners like me! On top of it, some dark cloud suddenly appears on the left, and destroys the whole game play,and it\'s game over again!\ud83e\udd2f For me, I uninstalled...needs something more than just shooting gorillas out of barrels! But, it does have potential to be fun, if the levels slowly increase in difficulty! \ud83d\ude10","This game has smooth playability, great visuals that remind me of the SNES Donkey Kong games, and the right balance of difficulty.

Now most don\'t work (rip Adobe Flash Player). It looks good and feels polished. But it is a game you can jump on for a few minutes, or for hours. Lots of content not blocked by paywalls. The cannon shoots bombs, which do run out. You can either buy more or watch an ad to get 200 every 20 minutes. 200 is more than plenty. I wish all games were this fair to players. Well done!","Feels like the desktop version. So many games lose something in playability terms when they move to mobile versions (Lemmings, I\'m looking at you!).

I used to play it and a few others by the same team years ago on PC. They\'re Flash games, and that format got to be too risky to play, so I\'m stoked that they ported some over to Android. I\'d love to see more, especially the Zombie Demolition and a building one like it. The ads for this one aren\'t nearly as bad as for SO many other games.

Controls are mildly unintuitive at first, but they are excellent after a few rounds. The primary downside is the ads; there does not appear to be a premium version to eliminate them, and you have to actually install the app from an ad to get additional gameplay boosts (vaccinations). I would prefer to pay a couple of dollars for a no-ad version and purchase boosts as needed (or at least not have to download unwanted apps).","Okay so... This game is awesome so far. Pretty damn hard but if you like or even love challenges. If you do than this is the game for you. Not to many ads which is really good. Graphics are really good. Concept is awesome. Good amount of levels so far. Having a hard time trying to beat it. It\'s just that difficult. Nearing the end though. Kinda wishing there were more levels but I haven\'t gotten all the stars for everything yet so it does have good replay value. I recommend it across the board. Get this game folks!","This game is unpredictable! Same puzzle can be solved in many ways yet, there are hidden tricks that may or may not help you improve your strategy (no hacks). Time is of essence here, and like biological forms, it\'s about the survival of the fittest, these digital bugs become aggressive. It makes me think of different alternatives that otherwise I wouldn\'t. Every time I was exterminated, it forced me to think what went wrong with my approach. Addictive! Well done!!!","Really fun strategy game that has a lot more depth to it once you realize all the different uses for the bridges between cells. Tons of fun, and a game I expect to play through completely. The only possible issue I can see is that the tutorial was a tad short, and explained basic mechanics, without expounding much on the different ways to use those mechanics, leading to a bit of confusion and frustration on some early levels, while you teach yourself some strategy. That might be a good thing or a bad thing, depending on the player. Regardless, the game is fantastic.","Overall decent game. As others have said it gets a bit too hard quickly, but with a little luck and some good strategies most levels can be beaten without using special items. a few, however, seem to require them. This would be more acceptable to me if it didnt happen in the 2nd set, but was closer to the end. There are also fewer levels than I would like. Pull back on the difficulty jump a little, add some levels, and I\'d probably give this 5 stars."],"appId":"com.fdgentertainment.tentaclewars.gp.free","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fdgentertainment.tentaclewars.gp.free&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.noodlecake.ssg2":{"title":"Super Stickman Golf 2","description":"Looks and plays great on phones and tablets!\\n\\nThe sequel to the award winning and critically acclaimed, Super Stickman Golf is here!!! \\nSuper Stickman Golf 2\xae out does the original in almost every way possible.

I\'ve been playing this game on and off for around 7 years now, and it hasn\'t gotten old. The one unfortunate part is that the online servers don\'t seem to be up anymore, but the single-player mode is more than enough to warrant playing it regularly. Highly recommend, even to try just once.","Four stars for great gameplay, fun level design and cool collectibles. The only problem is the XP and the forever ads. XP is broken and takes tons of grinding to move up a level, and, for some reason, I have been getting ads that I am not able to skip and they essentially prevent me from playing the game. Overall, four stars is a good rating.","I liked this one almost as much as I liked the original. I\'m a bit of a hipster, so I didn\'t care for the graphical changes much. The ads are pretty sparse, and you can watch ads to earn in-game currency to buy hats and unlock skins. I have only two real complaints: 1) The final levels are ABSURDLY hard, especially in comparison to the rest of them. 2) The final achievements are basically only achievable if you pay for the 2x EXP boost right at the outset. Otherwise, this one\'s a lot of fun.","Man it\'s pretty close to perfect. No pay2win at all - in fact it\'s quite easy to get the bux for hats etc. I love the challenge of trying to beat records at different courses (Though I wish you could see what the \\"World\'s best\\" score on each hole is, and maybe a seperate score for \\"dryball\\" and not). I\'ve spent several hours on the game, now just grinding out exp for the expansion levels... btw it sucks you need to levelup to unlock levels, I wish it was stars that counted them instead. Nicegame","A masterful golf experience that you\'d expect from a grab n\' go golf game. No prior experience required, simply aim your shot and be prepared to score it through a plethora of different obstacles! I enjoy the game so much that I made it to level 22 to unlock another set of play fields! What a bonus! To get to level 22, it\'s not easy though. It challenges you to go back and reply all earlier levels and grab all of the golf bux. I realized this very early on and bought 1 hat (pirate hat)!

I voluntarily watched an ad to continue my game. The Trailer Park Boy ad loaded at a smaller resolution than my screen so the x button did not align with its true location. It opened the Google Play store instead of closing. I\'m sick of countdown to close, and having to hit x in three different locations to close. If I like a game, I typ. pay the fee to remove mandatory ads however, I didn\'t get far enough in the game to decide.","I actually really love this game! The graphics are cute, peaceful, and very much well done. It\'s relaxing and fun with a mode where you don\'t even have to collect points and it\'s strictly for just cruising the mountains which I find very helpful to just have fun. Only thing I wish was different is in this \\"zen mode\\" that it has is that you don\'t crash when hitting rocks or bad flips. If you would just bounce back in zen mode rather than stopping it would be more zen. Otherwise love this\ud83d\udc4d","Such a time consuming game I started playing it an hour ago, and couldn\'t stop. The best part of this game is that theres not that many ads. But sometimes the game bugs out, and i can\'t jump. Also its one of those games that are really relaxing and is about beating your high score on that you got on your last round. Overall, adictive and fun game.","Ita a great and beautiful game. Quick to understand, fast paced, and for the most part, fun. The only issue I have with it is that some deaths feel unfair. Like how is the game going to allow me to fly into the sky but not tell me if I\'m not landing into a chasm. More than half my deaths are caused by being unaware that I am going to crash into one. It\'d really help if there was an indicator that I was going to encounter one, because late game you are in the air alot with the wingsuit."],"appId":"com.noodlecake.altosadventure","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.noodlecake.altosadventure&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.noodlecake.reallybadchess":{"title":"Really Bad Chess","description":"Really Bad Chess is just like chess, but with totally random pieces.

Would be nice if you could actually capture a piece that put you in check. My first game after the tutorial led to a sequence I had calculated and decided to move ahead with my plan because, if check, then I take, but the game would only allow me to move my king out of danger, not capture the attacking piece. I\'m not sure if this was a glitch, but certainly aggravating enough for me to uninstall.","Pretty fun. I have ads blocked so I don\'t have the same issues as other reviewers and I can\'t attest to their frequency. As a \\"regular\\" chess player it\'s fun to play around with and makes you stay very aware of what you might be hanging with every move. At a certain point you just aren\'t going to beat an AI that has 5 queens, so it\'s limited to something you mess with every once in a while and not really something you can progress in. I will never get used to seeing pawns on their own back rank.","I love the concept of the game, I didn\'t know anything about chess but after playing free play for a while and it goes me understand what I can move where. However the ads are completely unreasonable... I understand having an ad after like every other round, but say you lose, the ai move so fast and ends the game just to load the ad so fast you have no idea who won or lost, how, or why. After every.. single... Round... only to click the X 3 or 4 times just to start a new round... Might delete..","Fun game! It\'s a great idea that seems like it shouldn\'t work but does somehow. It probably won\'t help your chess game, but challenges your over the board play in ways you might not have imagined. *EDIT* This game used to be fun, but now it just freezes constantly and the daily challenge doesn\'t update anymore. From 5* to 2* until it gets fixed, if it ever does.","Fun concept, with totally random pieces all over the place. Fun at first, but I\'ve played chess for a while. If your score gets high enough, pretty soon the imbalance of the pieces is impossible. I played one game where the AI had SIX QUEENS. No amount of creativity or skill will beat that. I understand the need for ads, though they are annoying. But when it\'s impossible to compete, how is that fun?

I have enjoyed playing this game for hours on end but it is very buggy and glitchy. After the update I had major flooding so I stopped playing for a few days hoping I wouldn\'t have to restart. The water drained but then the game started with these annoying glitches. I keep losing many lives and many many many items because of the glitches that make it slow down or pause after each move I make. It\'s getting very frustrating. I hope the developers fix this soon!!","Really fun and addicting. Only downside is how sometimes it lags or kinda glitches. This is the kinda game where any wrong move and you die/it\'s all over. So it stuttering or messing up frequently during gameplay makes it very frustrating to play. Other than that, it\'s fun, addicting, and definitely a time killer!!!","I started playing on my Samsung Galaxy phone in the beta version thing. There was no option to save progress. I then wanted to use the tablet version. It says to login with Facebook to save progress, but I don\'t think it is actually saving anything. Now all I see is lagging. Half of the time my character is missing from the screen at start up. I need a game that at least moves the character when apply controls not 30 seconds later.","The game is really fun but it is full of glitches. I have had to uninstall it 3 separate times already losing everything, elevators don\'t work correctly, super ore extractors just disappear and the ore turns gray with no money, sometimes I get to a point and can\'t even play it cause it\'s like skipping and freezing, rock that I haven\'t excavated is missing when I play the game the next day, just to name a few. Obviously the game was thrown together quickly and poorly. I am so done with this game!","Awesome. Such an addicting game. Ads only happen every so often. Devs listen to feedback and update when necessary. 10/10 Would love to see more explosive types and other forms of building items such as ladders that don\'t burn you from sliding too fast or even stairs or a fire house pole to slide down.

I always have 2 or 3 Shields but that doesn\'t help because there is nothing I can do to stop my ship from smashing into the cave ceiling until they are gone and so is my ship.

However, for over a week, I am stuck with the same goals: get swishes with the gold ball. I cannot complete the goals with no gold balls and no way to get any. I think implementing a way to maybe spend coins to remove goals/challenges or to buy balls would be a great feature and very helpful in situations like this.","RUINED! This game used to be awesome, played it for years. They\'ve changed the shooting mechanics which are now horrible, the ads are even worse, and now you get a gold coin for every shot which aside from the constant dinging sound being annoying, What in the everyone gets a trophy is this??? With a heavy heart, I\'m uninstalling. Dueces.","So I enjoy this game but I think I might be going a little crazy. I first played this game on fb messenger and it had a story mode where you had to make it to the pros. You had an agent and basically you had to perform certain tasks to unlock the next level. Score x amount of points or hit x amount of threes in a row. I stoped playing for a bit. Then downloaded the app bad there was no story mode. Am I crazy or was there at one point a story mode.","It\'s a nice simple game, the reason for my rating is that it has serious lag issues with it. It seems like every other ball I shoot, it freezes for a second and i miss the shot because it didn\'t finish tracking my finger movement. If it weren\'t for that I would have given a 4 star. Hope to see this fixed.","I used to love this game but it recently got moved to Facebook. I have no Facebook I think it\'s a waste of time.

Good news is, the pricing is pretty generous. 10 bucks for 2K gold will cover a lot of upgrades that will get you a good deal further into the game, but you\'re definitely gonna have to spend more later on. It\'s a fairly good game, but if you\'re strictly looking for a f2p game, don\'t bother with this one. You\'ll uninstall after the first chapter.","Very fun TD through the first 4 sectors --enjoyed it a ton. The Fog scenarios can be difficult, but also a nice challenge. Somewhere in sector 5, the game becomes nearly unplayable. The level rewards are capped, so you won\'t be able to grind. And unfortunately, meaningful upgrades are approaching 1000 gold, so you can\'t earn them anyway. If you want to support the game, do so early when the upgrades are affordable. Gold becomes increasingly worthless as a single upgrade can go over 10,000 gold towards the later part of the tree. Good TD, but you\'ll almost certainly leave a lot of content unplayed due to the extreme difficulty, and inability to upgrade.","It was good, great even, then I got to the very middle of chapter 5. I\'ve gone back and beaten just about every level prior, to its fullest, and still cannot unlock enough upgrades to beat this level. I refuse to pay to win a game. I\'ve watched enough extra starting money ads to pay twice over for this game and now I feel as though I wasted all this time because someone, somewhere, decided to be a bit greedier them they should\'ve been.","Very good TD until...You get to chapter 5. It becomes impossible to progress without paying into the game. I don\'t mind the fuel system as it replenishes quickly enough. The fact that you can\'t replay levels for gold is where it really kicks you in the nuts. The tech trees are really cool, as well as the commander characters. I just wish you could grind gold."],"appId":"com.Sateda","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Sateda&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.mergedomhomedesign.game":{"title":"Mergedom: Home Design","description":"Do you see yourself as the best designer ever?

Be sure to update Mergedom for the latest content!","comments":["I absolutely love this game. I got rid of the ads which I think was totally worth it. I know the time on the reset for items is long, but I find it beneficial bc it gives me a stopping point. Normally I would only rate this 3 or 4 stars bc of a lack of update and items disappearing, however, the tech support is amazing! They\'ve helped me troubleshoot and returned my items everytime. No other game I\'ve played has done that.","Was 5 stars but watching an ad used to give 40 energy, but now only gives 25 energy and most of the time the ads won\'t load. SO frustrating! I now spend more time watching (or trying to watch) ads than I do playing the game. Update 8/23/22: I can\'t get more energy watching ads anymore...it just gives an error message. I can\'t reload full capacity of an item anymore...it just gives an error message. It\'s been out of levels (rooms to decorate) for a while, so now I can\'t even play to level up.","I would give this 4 stars, but it\'s been so long since there\'s been a content update (no new rooms to decorate) so after awhile it just gets tedious. Other than that, it in is one of the better merge games. One thing that I would appreciate would be the ability to expand the rewards (baskets, etc) so we can pick what we want to use when we want to, because otherwise you might have to put several on the board before you get the one you need. Takes up too much space.","1 extra star bc the game could be a lot of fun, but the amt of ads are insane. I might be able to play for literally 2 mins w/ full energy, after that I can\'t go 15-20 secs w/out a 30 sec ad. I\'m not exaggerating either, if anything it\'s more like every 5-10 secs. There\'s a pay option w/ no ads but this is seriously over the top. If it wasn\'t for the ridiculous amt of ads I\'d be hooked, but as it is I\'m only playing to earn $ for another app & as soon as I finish the task, I\'m uninstalling.","I like the game. I thought about purchasing the ad free, but thought against it because it is slow progress, low coins, amount of stars to decorate the rooms keep increasing, but the amount of stars receive for the merged items remains the same at 1 - 3 stars. The timing on the to reset items just unreasonably long. barely received coins. Some items are 1000 coins. Uninstalled, but will try again. Update: I reinstalled, now getting lots of ads and less playing time. No enticing at all."],"appId":"com.mergedomhomedesign.game","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mergedomhomedesign.game&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.zuma.deluxe.marble.puzzle":{"title":"Marble Master: Match 3 & Shoot","description":" The brand-new match 3 bubble shooter game!

I have passed several levels, got off the game and I was right back where I was. I had also collected the daily rewards and lost them, and have to recollect them every time. You need to fix the update. Not worth playing now. Update: Thank you for reaching out on this review. My issues have been resolved. And I am enjoying the game again. Thank you for the gifts.","Loved this game until 3 days ago. I get to level 339 and run out of lives. Not a problem. When I go back to play, all of my progress is reset to level 329. Thought it was just a glitch, but not only has this happened three days in a row, today I finally beat 339 make it to level 340, and my progress was reset less than five minutes later when I logged back in. Very disappointed because I really loved all the parts of game play, not just marble shooting.","UPDATE: I contacted the developer and they made udates to the game for the issue I ran into. Now, I\'m back to playing one of my favorite games!!! Thanks!!\u263a\ufe0f ISSUE 8/7: Made it to level 226, this is where the game becomes bogus. The level challenges you to collect 40 Yellow balls and 40 Silver balls. Guess what, they never send out any of the Silver balls. And, there is no guide on how to create the balls or make them appear. \ud83e\udd14","Thank you! Back to 5 stars. And I appreciate the offer to restore my level, but I love playing and will get back up there soon (and I\'m not sure of the exact level!). I love this game, but now it won\'t save. Every time I exit and go back in it goes back to level 322. And all the extra levels don\'t save either. Will be back to 5 stars when this is fixed.","This game understands what made Zuma fun better than all of the other clones: tight controls and satisfying combos. Having 10 stone balls in a row get deposited is a treat, and the slamming physics are decent enough. It\'s new mechanics are also interesting and set it apart from its froggy inspiration. However, there are infrequent lag spikes and the shooter feels vaguely racist, which prevents me from giving it a 5 star review."],"appId":"com.zuma.deluxe.marble.puzzle","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zuma.deluxe.marble.puzzle&hl=en&gl=us"},"linkdesks.bubblegames.bubbleshooter.royal.pop":{"title":"Bubble Shooter Royal Pop","description":"\ud83d\udc51 POP ALL BUBBLES IN THE ROYAL KINGDOM: Match Colors, Shoot Bubbles, Solve Puzzles, Enjoy and Relax!\\n\\n\u2728 Bubble Shooter Royal Pop is the classic and most addictive bubble pop matching game for FREE!

It\'s just straight Match-3 with nothing to distract from the overall experience. I don\'t want or need story lines. It is super touch friendly, so be cautious if you make your moves with your fingers instead of stylus. Easy to follow and keep up. Plenty of opportunity to gain bonuses and keep on playing. :o)","This game is similar to Royal Match which is a great game. So this game has the potential to also be great if the developers stay on top of things. Must keep new levels coming as well as new challenges and competitions. Teams will also be a welcomed addition. Great start here with nice graphics and it worked flawlessly. Keep up the good work!","Frustrating!! This is a fun little game! EXCEPT for the algorithm is off! Every single time I try to do an ad to double coins etc it says, \\"Ad loading\\" and bounces me!! Fix that issue and I would gladly spend $$ to play! It\'s that fun... fix and I will change stars!","I\'m looking for a game my team can move to. I thought this was it. Sadly, it\'s not. Like others have said, it follows Royal Blast. I think it\'s a better game than Royal Blast but it gets too difficult in the upper levels. The cost of boosters and extra lives are ridiculousy high. I\'ll keep it for a little longer.","Just started playing, but so far I am enjoying the game. Only issue is, when I go to the ad to get free booster or anytime the game goes to the advertisement, I can\'t get back to the game.

Thanks for the quick fix \ud83d\udc9c Loved it, until it kept freezing on me. I reached level 339 and it froze when I was almost done with the board. Continued to happen on this level for 3 days. Today it finally stayed unfriendly and I passed! Only to get frozen in the very next level after less than 15 seconds playing \ud83d\ude10 will give it a few days and if it doesn\'t get fixed will have to uninstall...","fun game to play with your own background noise. easy levels and I like that their are different balls to choose from. However they\'re not many levels and once you finish a room you\'re done still need to update this game and I didn\'t find any small mini games inside of it so the advertisement is way off don\'t get this it lasted me maybe a week and a half very disappointed.\ud83d\ude10","Great game, however it has way way to many ads. I really enjoy the game. But seriously an ad between every board, amd sometimes in the middle of the game. And it gives the option to add 50 more balls, well I have done this time amd time again, and always have to watch ad which I\'m ok with watching an ad for some extra balls. However after watching ad I receive NO extra balls at all. So there for a total waste of time. I think they only do it to get ad\'s watched, but yet again I receive NO BALLS","I\'m deleting. It\'s fun, but I\'m tired of it always popping up \\"Trial period is over. Do want to upgrade?\\" The answer is a resounding no and will remain no. Make it to where that pop-up can be turned off, so non-paying players can have fun without being hounded to death to buy the freaking game.","Until now, level 1062..the game was a decent game. But now all of a sudden, if you don\'t clear the level it tells you to spend 200 coins to keep playing, if you don\'t have 200 coins..you start over. So now it\'s FORCING a player to pay real money?... Game isn\'t worth that, AND.. quite the scam...it\'s definitely earns a major negative star rating"],"appId":"com.bricksbreakerballs.royal.king.ball.blast","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bricksbreakerballs.royal.king.ball.blast&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.india.vs.pak.mega.classic.ludo":{"title":"Ludo Online Multiplayer","description":"Ludo Online Multiplayer - Dice Board Game game played between royal kings and brilliant-minded people.

I hope they\'re easy to acquire and I don\'t encounter similar tactics, as the stamina system was a red flag right off the bat. Edit : I was fortunately mistaken in my assumptions. Some mild inconvenience here & there, but overall a very fun game so far. Relative to so many other apps on play store, this one is a rare delight.","Very difficult game, but compared to other reviews, they have mentioned that the drop rates aren\'t low, they\'re random. Got a legendary item literally second day of playing, and two blue items on top of that. Very addicting, but the life/heart system slows down how much you can play. If it had a rework on how it takes heart\'s, I would(personally) have no problems. \u2764 \ud83d\udc99 \ud83d\udc9c \ud83d\udc96 \ud83d\udc97 Edit; to be clear, the drop rate is NOT low, it\'s RANDOM, meaning it has any chance of dropping an item.","It\'s pretty fun. Controls are solid and getting new equipment feels rewarding. There are options to pay for in game currency, but as long as you check in everyday for the daily reward and progress with the achievements, you\'ll get plenty of currency. Overall, solid game that doesn\'t feel repetitive or underwhelming.","So far as much as I\'ve played, it\'s really really fun! One of the best mobile games I\'ve played, but I have to give only 4 stars because it has the most annoying feature you can put in a game: having those hearts that limit how much you can play at a time. If it didn\'t have that it would be a 6 star game and I would recommend it to friends, but I find it to ruin a good game to add that lives system. What you could do is make it cost a life of you die on a stage, rather than every time you play","Fun game! The range of controls and skills are just enough to be challenging. I\'ve been grinding Chapter 1 bosses for a couple days but still no keys - a higher key drop rate would be nice, especially so early in the game. If I can find a couple keys without too many more rounds of bosses, I might push it to 5 stars. Edited: I\'m not the only one having problems. Please fix drop rate!!! Impossible to forward otherwise. Edit 2- random doesn\'t work for such important parts.

On top of that, some of the ads glitch and take forever to load or not load at all and then I have to close and reopen the app only to find out I have to watch the ad again or I had lost that reward. FIX THAT!!!","So I rate this really a 3 and a half but I\'ll give it 4, the game is fun, I really enjoy it, and I keep finding myself distracted for long periods of time playing this. I am a VIP and relish in all the exclusive content, however I feel the game needs a little more. The game seems partly unfinished and could do with some more things to do like a multiplayer or build your own player for the VIP\'s. Despite that I do recommend the game to anyone giving it a glance. (Also ads need fixing in the game)","Good game, no bugs or issues. Just wish more options to customize your team were added such as The Clippers, The Bucks, The Nets, The Knicks, and The Lakers (this is someone who is not a fan of those teams, Let\'s Go Suns). Edit 1: Now there are a lot of bugs after the last update. The app crashes a lot after ads, and it will take my Club Coins and will not upgrade buildings; FIX YOUR GAME!","The game can be fun. To achieve this fun you first NEED to BUY Vip...thats because after about lvl 19 the coin gain is drastically less then your costs. The next reason is i guess you need the 2nd shop option the VIP option without that forget getting a strong team. Daily rewards also let you down if you dont have VIP. My team is all level 43 and i am 1 match before the last continent but it slowed don soo hard that its been 5 days now and i cant reach higher.","Great game but it\'d be better if you added managers to buy and if its only for gold. Me and my friends were talking about it and managers that collect your players money even if its only for 1 position. Also adding small passive buffs to the players would be cool too just something me and my friends think is a good idea also add more to the map. Im only on the first part but still a fun game itll suck to only have the 3 continents to beat maybe 5 i dont know you plans but good game so far."],"appId":"com.gaminho.idlefivebasketball","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gaminho.idlefivebasketball&hl=en&gl=us"},"bazinac.aplikacenahouby":{"title":"Mushrooms app","description":"The application includes a detailed guide including the 200+ most common types of mushrooms, with detailed descriptions and quality photos.

This app is very well put-together. I wish all identification apps were setup like this one. You begin with relating the basic shape, size, and gill/other information and the app narrows down your search. Tap on the basket at the bottom, and it gives additional options for narrowing your search (stem and cap characteristics, etc.)","Incredibly versatile and useful. They absolutely need to expand their catalogue, though. Minor note, I can\'t click the URL link on some descriptions because they are at the bottom of the info cards, which overlap the navigation buttons on my phone. Maybe add a small dead zone banner as a footer to compensate for this in some phones.","I don\'t like the design overall. The art is beautiful but the app cover has a large key covering the art and it just looks terrible. It also only gives the scientific names of the mushrooms when your scrolling, which could be confusing for beginners in mushrooms. If you\'re looking for a good mushroom app i would recommend shroomify, it\'s easier to navigate.","Amazing app! I love the fact that you can look at recipes and that there is a Journal. The purchased aren\'t required, but I bought them anyways to support the developers. Yes, the predictions can be wrong at times, but it does give you a warning to not 100% trust their predictions. The only complaint I have is that there could be more mushroom species, but it\'s fine. Also, you can download one of the features without paying and it still works, you might want to fix this.","i wish the recognition wasn\'t so hard to snag the photo and also would like to be able to mark on map where i found the species and able to see others picks. now i know nobody gives their picking spot, but that option for those who dont mind, would be nice. plus are all north American species in this app? thank you for making something that ensures that I know what I\'ve got, beyond a reasonable doubt."],"appId":"bazinac.aplikacenahouby","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bazinac.aplikacenahouby&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.EightStudio.PitzMaker":{"title":"PitzMaker","description":"Create your own OC (Original Character)!\\nYou can create the loveliest OCs and save them!\\n\\n\u25c6Various Items for Character Customization!\\nYou can create various OCs with a wide range of colorful items.\\nNew items are being updated constantly!\\nPlease let us know if there is a certain design you want!

But the only problems are the limited color ranges. I suggest adding a color spectrum so you can choose whatever color you want instead of having to go through the work to install an entirely different app just so you can change the color of hair, background, clothes, etc. Other than that, i really like this app.","Let\'s you create a unique OC and has a good base. Like many have mentioned it would be better to have a color wheel for the hair color. Also it gives the option to watch ads for points to unlock other content, however, there is no where the points are tracked nor a store in which to buy different things. You just watch ads and points just go off into the nether never to be seen again.","I love this game! The different styles, accessories, and moods you can make these characters have are unimaginable! My only downfall with this app is the color choices, and other options for clothes or hair or different categories, is that they are rather limited, I\'d suggest adding a color wheel for players to choose from, and adding more styles and options for and to shirts for a cuter oc. Besides that, great game!","The game\'s pretty good, but somewhat limiting. There feel like should be more options. Plus, every so often, the game stops loading. It gets to 82-92%, and then it just freezes. You can undo this by reinstalling, but then you lose all your points, which makes it take even longer.","It\'s a good app and I do have fun, it\'s just that I wish for more skin tones like brown and black.maybe more eye diversity and fat character designs. All and all, I like it and I want to see it grow. Update, the app keeps crashing. It\'s been like a year ago since a fix.

Just want to let you know some things I think that could be added and improved. 1)Unique Generals or Commanders that can be summoned, and used to attack other cities, and also defend the city. 2)Increasing your Population and Resource productions by conquering Other Cities. It would also be an OVERKILL if you can choose from Fantasy Races like Elves, Orcs, Dwarves, Goblins, and Humans. If Unique cities can be built, and Unique armies can also be trained...","This Game is awesome.

I\'m not a fan of the controls, but everything else is great. A fun time killer with no ads! Overall enjoyable with many different classes, lots of unlockable features that don\'t cost real money. I would prefer a virtual joystick for moving, but that wouldn\'t work with the the current game interface. Give this game a try.","This game is the hiddem gem of offline, detailed, strategic, and action-packed RPGs. At first, the controls are odd, but they soon become instinctive. The level of detail to the gameplay, stories, levels, and equipment in this game is incredible too! On top of that, if you don\'t know something about anything, like a skill or an enemy, just click the question mark button up top to read a short summary. The classes are great and you can pick up spells along the way to custom-build your own class!","Everything you could possibly expect out of a game like Cardinal Quest!!! Absolutely no paywall, everything can be unlocked by just enjoying the content, each area is procedurally generated (new layout each time), 3 difficulty settings to satiate every type of gamer, turn-based play that doesn\'t rush you at all, and very very easy on the battery! Most games on the app store barely make it 2 days on my phone. I keep coming back to this one anytime I need to pass some time on my phone. 6 stars!","I don\'t care how many times I play this, I always come back for more. Definitely starts as a beginner\'s roguelike, the difficulty can get pretty unforgiving. It\'s rogue-lite elements give it more replayability, IMO, and a way for the less-hardcore-gamers among us a way unlock, not only small advantages, which can make all the difference, but entirely new classes, all of which present entirely new gameplay approaches.","Fun RPG: Really good gameplay. If you click on the magnifying glass at the top you can see a description of anything. My only complaint is the placement of the consumable items because I will accidentally click them instead of the ability. You can buy morale, but it is NOT in your face. You can do everything in the game without microtransactions, and it does not feel like a grind."],"appId":"com.kongregate.mobile.cardinalquest.google","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kongregate.mobile.cardinalquest.google&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.funload.killmonster":{"title":"Clicker Monster: RPG Idle Game","description":"Is killing monsters tiring and boring?

Two things I wish were explained further though. who drops artifacts (you get a +% artifact drop rate) and what are Honesty and Loyalty?

Otherwise I have no complaints, great job!

Font size issues, such as the description button on the corners of the skills. It\'s really easy to accidentally click the description button. You store loot you\'ve accumulated and when you click that a box takes up the middle of the screen so you have to close it. Both of these could be fixed/set with menu options. Also the random ads that play without clicking on anything are supposed to have an option to pay (which I would) to get rid of them, but the pay link is broken.","I really like the game so far but I only have one complain, it\'s about the animation timing, the enemy seems to die even before the sword is swing. It\'s bothering me because the enemy will disappear and my hero will swing at nothing. I only realized this problem after levelling up. Hope you guys could do something about this cause I really like the game","Good base idea. Scaling is way off, never lost a point of hp before resets. Ads are out of control. 5 ads to hit max boost is brutal. But worst of all, the pop up without warning. I\'ve had 3 pop up within 5 seconds of gameplay.","Not really sure if the devs even listen to feedback, it\'s been out for so long in beta, my only complaint is there is no option to pay once to remove ads, it\'s beyond frustrating with the random ads, sometimes I\'ll pop all my buffs and then get 2 consecutive ads and lose my buffs out of NO WHERE, please for the love of God get rid of the random pop up ads or let me pay a fee to get rid of them, this came out in 2019 and it should have been addressed long ago with so many complaints","The game is interesting, the multiple classes are cool, and I like the graphics, but i think i have a small issue. I did the 13 dollar for 1200 warrior package and under that says \\"extra\\" 1200 was I supposed to get 1200 or 2400, I got the former and was curious if maybe the wording is off cause it sounds like it\'s supposed to give 2400 total, my username is GNTA"],"appId":"com.OpenWorldInteractive.ClickerWarriors","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.OpenWorldInteractive.ClickerWarriors&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.chillgaming.combatquest":{"title":"Combat Quest Roguelike Archero","description":"The world of magic and heroes, in the genre of rpg games online and roguelike, needs bow masters to protect it.\\n\\nBowmasters!

Says \\"No internet connection\\" on both wifi and 4G(they both are working outside of the game) tried resetting my phone, nada. Uninstalled and reinstalled the game...same error. Very unfortunate..was having fun (used to love Archero) Hopefully if it gets resolved, I didn\'t lose all my progress and purchases when it comes up again.","This game has it\'s ups and downs. It seems quite passable for the first 4 areas. Then it\'s absolutely impossible to go any further at all. Which is incredibly frustrating...I cannot emphasize that enough. I\'ve been stuck on the same area ever since I downloaded the game. Leveling gear and heroes takes way to long and takes a lot of hours, therefore makes it not worth it to play the game. Fix your enemy balancing, I would like to play more levels and get further. But it seems quite impossible.","This game is so much fun. I\'ve been playing this one AND the first one both, and I normally would have gotten bored and burnt out on a game by now as much as I\'ve been playing. But, there is definitely a good reason this was rewarded the most innovative game of 2019. I only have one complaint. Whenever I click to watch an ad for free coins, free spin, etc. if I happen to interact with the ad for even one second it sends me back to the title screen at 80% of the time I have to rewatch it anyways","It\'s a typical Archero clone with pretty graphics. A major negative is that there\'s no difficulty scaling. It goes all in from the start. You can grind, but what they want you to do is buy something. Like the ad removal that only removes some very specific ads, because they still want that ad revenue too. So long story short, they\'re not interested in making a fun, balanced game. They just want your money.","Update, went from 4 stats to 3 when I realized most people were right about the scaling after the fourth portion of the map. But what led me to degrade my stars was mainly the crashing of the game. It started off only crashing right after ads (with no rewards frustrating) but now it\'s like randomly every 5-10 min. Great game ... Sincerely. But this frustration makes it possibly worth deleting."],"appId":"com.chillgaming.combatquest","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chillgaming.combatquest&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.alicegames.idle.rpg.battler":{"title":"Darkest AFK - IDLE RPG offline","description":"Welcome to the Darkest AFK - colorful adventure and amazing Turn Based RPG story.

Surely is a spectacle. The graphics and animations are beautiful and gameplay wise there is a plethora of things to do. The only thing even remotely wrong with this game, and this is my personal opinion, are the undead heroes. Legitimately they serve little-to-no purpose; obsolete. Other than that dinky little feature, this game is immaculate!","Is some lack of variety to the early game (I haven\'t gotten too far) but the art is cool and progressing is fun. Would love to see some more interesting options with for equipment-- every new item or upgrade is just flat out better. I wish I could choose between buffing a specific stat, perhaps at the cost of another, or give a hero resistance to status conditions. As it stands the only way hero\'s roles feel distinct is there special ability. Also I don\'t understand the function of fallen heroes","It\'s okay for the first couple hours but then you reach a plateau or you have to either buy or cease your attempts to try... I\'ve been playing for over a week now. And I\'m able to advance one or two levels per day. However during the first few hours I was able to advance a couple hundred levels. Overall it\'s a very imbalanced boring as hell game!","It\'s a fairly decent game. My only complaints so far is: A. I cannot play the Arena of Doom. It constantly just pops up \\"Opponent Not Found\\". B. Power scaling in Labyrinth of Madness. For some reason the end boss (who had approximately 15-20% health) was able to defeat my team after a fresh revive in full torch light (meaning they should\'ve been much weaker). Not sure how that\'s supposed to work. Other than these, this is a pretty decent idle game if you got some time to waste.","So far the game is fun not to complicated. A great game to pick up and play a couple of rounds. Characters are cool and I love seeing the coming soon character. I have not had to purchase any in game item to have to progress which I highly appreciate. Although I will occasionally buy an item here an there. Thanks guy\'s you have a great fun game keep up the good work."],"appId":"com.alicegames.idle.rpg.battler","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.alicegames.idle.rpg.battler&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.survival.last":{"title":"Dawn of Zombies: Survival","description":"DoZ is an online simulator of survival in a post-apocalyptic world.

However there is a durability issue. Gear should not degrade so quickly. I haven\'t bought anything because of this. That being said I am still playing and progressing just fine. A simple fix would be to have durable gear be less effective at higher difficulty instances. This would generate more revenue and less frustration.","Very good game, one of my favorite. I really like the allie update, very good. It should have a way you can buy things in the wardrobe if you can\'t or don\'t want to wait almost a year for an event to unlock things like character skins. At least have 1 or 2 events that allow a time to buy things in the wardrobe. I\'ll try to think of new things as I play.","So tired of these games where you have to build up and collect stuff in order to advance. There\'s hardly any challenge. It\'s just plain boring. Guess it\'s the new generation, too lazy to work and challenge themselves. Definitely missing the days where the object of the game was to simply beat levels to progress to the next level without down time and waiting periods. \ud83d\ude34","Been playing it for about 4 days now it started off pretty good but the game keeps freezing or a message pops up telling me the app is not responding and I have to either close/restart or wait. At one point I had to turn off my phone twice because it it froze completely, I ended up getting a gamer booster app bcuz of it. ALSO, having the in-game offers on display makes it difficult to use the joystick because it causes accidental tap on them when moving around or dodging enemy attacks.","This by far is in my top 5 of all the games I\'ve ever played from the store. The only problems I\'ve experienced are the crashes. I miss a lot of opportunities because of this. There are deadlines to be completed but crash after crash, reopen, reopen. I\'m frustrated by this time and it\'s too hell with it........... For now then I\'m trying again.

The controls are not intuitive, red dots that usually signify where to press to progress are not used properly (it constantly leads me to reopen), and I found everything mushed together and too messy to see. Yes, it\'s pretty, but there\'s not much cohesion in the art either.

The mechanics are thoughtful and polished with genuinely challenging puzzles, breathtaking art, and a refreshing take on free-to-play mechanics. The character balance is exceptionally well done. No character stands out as \\"more powerful\\" than any other and each character can be used as part of an incredible array of strategies. Choosing skills, runes, and equipment to help each character fill the role you choose for them is an exercise in creativity and tactical prowess. The game has serious staying power with tons of different maps, fights, and varied game modes. You won\'t be \\"done\\" with it any time soon! The art in the game is brilliantly done and well showcased. And behind the art is an epic tale that unfolds one step at a time. This is a game well worth your time.","Good game, but frustrating user interface. I really like the concept of upgrading your existing gear until you are able to beat higher level opponents and craft higher level equipment. Managing character equipment is frustrating. Which character needs armor and health? Which character is my mage and which one is my tank? I forget because they come with pre-defined names that I can\'t change and there is no obvious description or classes. What gear do I currently have in my inventory, and which characters have the \'weakest\' gear that I know I need to upgrade? It takes too many clicks through too many characters and menus to try to figure this stuff out. And how do I know what stats I need to improve? Do I need more accuracy or more power? Parsing through 300 pages of combat logs to try to figure this out with no contextual help from the game is too time consuming. And there are too many stats to keep track of (24 I think?). This level of depth/complexity is probably good for someone who has tons of time and wants to go really deep into a game, but it is a turnoff for someone with only a limited amount of time to try to figure out game mechanics.","The concept is fine, but ultimately the mission timers just got to where the game became tap tap tap... Wait... Reopen app... Tap tap tap. Eventually I just found myself not reopening the app. Generally the game is well explained, but by area 3 you suddenly find yourself with so many options and formulae, optimization becomes dizzying. There\'s great transparency, but it\'s excessively complex. Some confusing things aren\'t explained like the meaning of an hourglass in skills. Good game overall.","Much much better with the latest update. Fun game with very good rewards for ads. Only thing I\'d recommend is some kind of guidance for which gear works best for which kind of adventurer. That way there wouldn\'t have to be so much trial and error. Not terribly unmanageable though. Great game!","I\'ve been playing Guild Masters in beta for a couple months now. I\'ve seen the game evolve over time into what it has become today. My best description for this game is quite simply that it is the best strategy game I\'ve ever played on a mobile device. I\'ve not encountered a game that is so full of depth and options and theory craft as this. While this might be a casual game, it\'s as far from a mindless idle clicker as you can get. Your choices matter. The runes you equip, the gear you select, the talent paths you choose all matter. Best of all, nothing is set forever. You can change all of these selections whenever you like. I\'ll end my review on 2 points: 1: The game has a thriving Discord community. I\'ve found the members to be so helpful and encouraging throughout my time playing the game. I\'ve not had this much interaction with a games creator before. The experience has been immensely refreshing. 2: I figure I\'ll mention the elephant in the room. Yes, the game has micro-transactions. If you buy everything, the numbers could add up. That said, the game is no where in the vicinity of pay to win. That said, you can unlock nearly everything in the game with gems, which are given through quests. The choice really is up to you. Personally, I\'ve sunk an absurd amount of hours into this game and have gotten my monies worth 40 fold. Here\'s the bottom line: If you\'re looking for a game with deep strategic choices, this game is for you. If you looking for a game to sort of mindlessly kill time without thinking much about what you\'re doing...this might not be your game."],"appId":"com.BaronnerieGames.Guildmasters","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.BaronnerieGames.Guildmasters&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.hariotica":{"title":"Hariotica: RPG adventure games","description":"Hariotica is a turn based RPG and one of the newest MMORPG open world 2d games.

Then I ran into clunky combat, a loot system that is largely unexciting, and bosses I can\'t seem to face. Not overcome, mind you; I literally cannot challenge most of the bosses alone. The game has great potential, but I couldn\'t find a reason to keep playing after about an hour.","Surprisingly good. Some skills don\'t seem to have much combat value such as reducing enemy HP as a necromancer. Item trading would be great, as you usually end up getting items for other classes. There are plenty of typos in descriptions. Some skills don\'t seem to be working properly - necromancer\'s shield doesn\'t always block the hit, even if you have mana. On the other hand, the concept is great and graphics are just right. Good job overall!","It\'s a fun game but is lacking the ability to change your characters appearance, the combat is alright but could use a more upgraded approach because most of the time you just do the same thing over and over. You need to insert matchmaking for the raids. There are hardly anyone on so it\'s had to do them.","I wish i could play but the game just freezes even if there are conection problems add a reconect feature rather than needing to restart the game is amazing and i cant wait to see waths gonna happen with it... Gonna keep trying and hope i dont freeze for now i guess","How should i play this game when it does not even allow me to enter?

Developers, please address this, ir constantly goes to the play store after each ad, and restarts the game, and we lose our reward. Now, we won\'t play the game, and you lose revenue. It has great potential, just make the bonuses worth more, make cash multiply faster, and fix ad glitch. Thanks for reading. \ud83d\ude04","Thos could easily be a 5 star game but for now I\'m giving it 4 stars reason being it takes so long to upgrade things in the house. Each item starts to cost about 100000 after upgrading meaning you can only upgrade an item or 2 before you run out of cash. Waiting 2 hours for the max reward offline doesn\'t give you very much either making it hard to progress. Make the game easier to progress and items easier to upgrade with money and you will have a 5 stars from me.","It is a fun game. The ads are not too bad. They are optional and speed up your progress. The only issue is it only takes a few days to max everything out. It says you can unlock the next part of the story and more characters at lvl 20 but the game has not yet been developed past that point so you cannot actual unlock what is next. I look forward to that being completed. I also wish you would unlock unacheivements for your Google Play account. No way to level up your account with this one.","I really enjoyed the game! Didn\'t have to spend any money to enjoy it fully or upgrade items. The ads aren\'t bad at all; I\'ve probably watched every single one to get the perks! Only downside is that I have all characters maxed out currently and all items fully upgraded. So probably going to uninstall and keep an eye out for a new update.","This game is mediocre. I say that having bought the no ads option, and having finished everything possible (other than cosmetic gem items). Character models are uncomfortable and creepy (that smile), game feels really unbalanced, and there really isn\'t much to do other than upgrade stuff. I was extremely disappointed that dialogue between the family dried up very fast, as that was the most enjoyable part of the game to me. I expected dialogue after every level, seems easy to implement."],"appId":"com.moondustries.idlefamily","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.moondustries.idlefamily&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.idle.hamster.energy":{"title":"Idle Hamster Energy","description":"Are you ready to manage your cute hamsters, and be a power tycoon?\\n\\nUpgrade your hamsters for more power and more hamsters.Train your hamsters and let them do anything for you, even light up a city.

Your game could be a fun, mindless game; but, the ads are too much. I get you want to make some money, but put the ads in a place that makes sense; not on some internal timer, or when you close out of a menu. Good lord.","Too many ads.

However, it\'s lacking AFK rewards. The saving after you\'ve done something is horrible as well. I leveled my skills did a dungeon and exited the game. Only to check a couple hours later and none of what I did saved. It\'s good to waste time on, However, without an AFK function its not easy to progress without leaving it open on your device constantly.","The best word to describe this game is underwhelming. It\'s okay in the beginning but then nothing interesting. No damage increases or bonuses for getting an extra 100 or 1000 levels into anything and it never feels any different. Even after unlocking the 100 crit hit chance it didn\'t feel much easier and only got a few extra stages before it was back to the grind. Also you have to idle with the phone on killing the battery.","Great concept, poorly executed. The afk rewards are pretty much non-existent. The RNG for equipment is equally terrible and is only outdone by the RNG for abilities on the equipment. The lvl gaps in power are...something else entirely, which isn\'t bad, but with no way to get enough gold unless you leave your phone open with the game running, your progress will be also non-existent.","Enjoying the game so far however I have noticed a few bugs with a couple of spells. The increase attack speed and damage spells don\'t actually apply the buff, and when you go to remove either of them from the spell line up, the screen starts flashing and the game freezes. Have to force restart each time to fix. I will update review to 5\u2605 once this has been fixed. Great game otherwise.","Hi, i like your game, but there is two things that makes me crazy... Item change option, please do some info pop out when u roll item affixes, and when u get epic or legend than block screen with pop out info like \\"are u sure u want change it?\\" U don\'t know how many legend affixes i just pressed to roll again... Other thing is, why there is no reborn option and like after reborn u start at lvl 1 stage,get materials to boost hero stats, some artficats/relics, and fast way back to your last stage"],"appId":"com.hadeul.mage","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hadeul.mage&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.lemonjamgames.idlehero":{"title":"Idle Summoner : Grand Battle","description":"Clicker Endless RPG.

The upgrade button disappears permanently when you get the third skill. Chara ters are mundane looking. Lots of ads.","Same game as Neon Impact. Nothing new to the game. Time Travel is basically going back to a certain stage but getting stronger. Getting those Soul Stones just like memory Fragments. You l lvl up your characters and so so. Similarly like neon impact. Nothing new to the game","The amount of adverts is absolutely magnificent. Adverts are literally everywhere. Whatever you do, you need to watch the advert.

Game was highly unstable when I picked it up, patches have greatly improved performance and crashes are rare now. There is an offline mode, survival mode, and online battle mode, in addition to the relatively new \\"breakthrough\\" and \\"phantomzone\\" modes for increased unlock potential. Also, did I mention there are zero ads??!! I do think the new Nth metal heroes are slightly overpowered, and expensive to level.","As much how much the game has died down I like to say that this is a real great game, I\'ve been playing this game since it was brand new and I still enjoy it the gameplay may just tapping the screen to attack but I like it that way, the graphics for a mobile game are good too, and the controls are again just tapping but I do think their a little delayed. My only problems are that its been a year since the game was updated and the block spamming from the A.I is ridiculous.","This game is awsome the fighting is simple and easy to understand and the range of characters and their depictions are super cool. The only thing that would make it better is if they had updated the graphics and save system instead of making a whole new game that is not as fun in my opinion because of the massive amount of commands you have to memorize inorder to fight.","It\'s good until you get to the doomsday boss battle. They make nightwing almost unbeatable to the point where you need a gold or promoted silver. I want a gold character so I\'m saving up but the health and damage boosts they give the opponents you face is ridiculous. The online is really good as it has proper scaling to character levels. If you have a console then you can get free things in the game, you just have to put a little bit of work into it. It\'s a great game, but it could be better","Gameplay wise, this game is amazing! The satisfaction of doing a successful combo on your opponent is levels over what I expected from a mobile game. But there is one problem I would want fixed. Most of the time, The game just closes itself when I win a battle. Thus, forcing me to play the same battles again and again. If you would fix this, this would change into a 5 star review. Just please, fix this. I really like this game, just this little bug is effecting my enjoyment of the game."],"appId":"com.wb.goog.injustice","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wb.goog.injustice&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.alohagamestudios.kingofheroes":{"title":"King of Heroes","description":"Your adventure begins now!

The characters have personality, and you can choose to up certain skills to shape the way they are useful to you. Best part, the game and continue being played for long or short amounts of time (unlike many games that basically make you wait for certain amounts of time). This means I can play at my own pace! Lots of fun for someone who usually finds mobile games boring or restrictive!","The game is very good but of course it is beta so there are some bugs. Bug one is the next wave button does not always work or if you do press it, it sends both waves at you. Bug two at least for me is the game sometimes freezes out during a fight has only done ite three times so I might just need to re-download it. Things to help liven the game up a little. I think you should allow at least 4 heros on the wall. Make it so you can move the characters and finally make it a little more engaging!!","4 stars for one reason only. I would like the battles to be more realistic, more 3D like with some mystery quests in between, not just static enemy movements. The music is nice it just looses its tone for a moment but I don\'t mind. Otherwise I like the artwork, the characters, the story, the rewards and the lobby is easy to navigate.","Pretty neat little game, not really a tower defense more like just tap the hell out of the screen but still it\'s a fun concept. No clear instructions on how to upgrade characters, what do stat points do etc but after 20 minutes of game play you kind of figure it out. I\'d say after an update or two if they went in the right direction with the game I would donate to the devs. Nice work overall.","Has potential but a bit lacking. Here are a few notes (maybe its my mistake or there really are no options for these) 1. Give option to move wizards after initial setting. 2. Exp bar with numbers. the number in scrolls lose meaning if we are guessing the wizards\' exp. 3. Information about the damage of taps? and how to make it stronger, etc. 4. Provide an in-game guide? like a compilation of the tips that are shown in between loading screens. They load too fast that I can\'t even finish reading"],"appId":"com.nijigames.leturn","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nijigames.leturn&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.llgroup.linearquestbattleidlerpg":{"title":"Linear Quest Battle: Idle Hero","description":"Dungeon crawl, create a hero party & earn loot in an epic incremental RPG.

I played the trial and couldn\'t get enough of the cute characters and storyline that I upgraded to the full version. The combat is fun and reminds me of my early final Fantasy days. It can get grindy at times for the more rare ingredients but nothing impossible to get.","Played a few hours and had a pretty good time! The story is simple but cute and the game is fun so far. I can tell it\'s going to be grind-heavy, but the music and atmosphere makes it pretty relaxing. Instead of buying the full game on mobile, though, I think I\'m going to wait for a sale on switch, since i like having physical buttons and a larger screen.","Unique game, most definitely. Not so much a fighting game although you do fight while out harvesting items for the tavern. The storyline is cute. Tutorial is very brief and then you are on your own to figure things out. I didn\'t mind although it took me a couple of hours to figure out how to level up characters. Addictive game for those who want to do something other than fight all the time.","This game is a very cute and very fun. I played the trail and liked it enough to buy the full version, and so far it\'s definitely been worth it. I love the cooking aspect, and being able to put battles on auto is great because I find them boring. My only real complaint is there are too many battles when you\'re exploring dungeons, which I would forgive if the monster repellent worked better. Also the speech isn\'t translated very well, but you do still get the idea of whats being said.","I enjoyed the game itself. The problem was when I bought it. I bought the game in the trial not seperately. After about 2 weeks of playing it doesn\'t work, I get the Kemco screen then it goes to a black screen and stays there. I uninstalled, reinstalled and lost everything. Such a waste of money :( Btw, I just posted this review and it was taken down, how odd, don\'t you agree?"],"appId":"kemco.rideonjapan.mareniabar","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=kemco.rideonjapan.mareniabar&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.guycorp.rpg.games.idle.merge.games":{"title":"Mergy: RPG game - PVP + PVE","description":"NEW PVP feature!

Works really well if you\'re looking for a game you don\'t have to pay much attention to while keeping your fingers busy clicking the screen. The characters are fun and unique with personalities similar to a variety of anime characters. I wish they had more dialog and text choices but not a bad start. Even with the glitches and lost bytes this game was better than I expected. Looking forward to seeing where it goes from here. Azure, Macaron, and Prisma are my favorites so far.","Nice game, I mean yeah this is a very nice and cute game I\'m starting to love it... But I\'ll just keep the other star until the bug in the tutorial gets fixed \ud83d\ude05, nah but don\'t worry if you quit then restart the game it\'ll progress... I just started and then encountered the bug so ... I\'ll just keep on playing and watch out for bugs I\'ll change this later on as I progress \ud83d\ude01...","This game is simple yet fun. The character designs are all really pretty and the chatting feature is nice. My only complaint is that, it\'s kinda hard to collect for summons. You have to upgrade your moeOS alot but still, it\'s a really fun and pretty game.

So many times I\'ve sent something off that has been delivered and I think \\"okay cool, I can delete that now\\" only to then have a need with the recipient where I need to look up when it was actually delivered and or what the tracking number even was at the time. I could just leave things in the Archive, but that would get very cluttered.","Awesome app! Must have if you are OCD or like to keep track of your items. Sometimes it lags compared to the actual shippers website but there is a shortcut button to take you to your tracking with your original shipper. If you open an email or an app with a tracking # then open the parcels app. It will automatically insert the tracking number and ask you if you want to track it. I love that you can label all your items as you wish. Definitely a must have for any business or personal.","*UPDATE* (from ** to *****) I originally cancelled my subscription a while back because the tracking was way off and the automatic archiving that was often won\'t was driving me crazy. The tracking problem is fixed and the automatic archiving is now a setting option. Plus they added a thumbnail picture of your order when you import from aliexpress which I love! A feature I would like would be the ability to make an archived package active again. Occasionally I hit the wrong button or package.","I have been comparing this app and another, similar app side by side. One thing that I\'ve found is that this app takes a lot longer looking up tracking information for a number, but is way more robust and doesn\'t need manual fiddling for tracking numbers. There was a couple of days where the app refused to work, but that has since been resolved. It also has a way to sort packages by last update which I find extremely handy and useful. I paid the $3.50USD/year for the update notifications, which work great. Overall, there are some improvements that could be made to the app, but it does the job and I\'m happy with it.","I ended up purchasing the 1 year subscription. Not because i have any need or use for it but because i really appreciate the app and especially enjoy reading it\'s creator\'s responses to snooty reviews. It\'s a nice breath of fresh air from all the American and Asian apps full of bugs, over complexity and extremely user unfriendly interfaces that make no sense. This app is straightforward, has everything you need and nothing else, save for adds which; get this, are easy to see but not in the way."],"appId":"com.brightstripe.parcels","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.brightstripe.parcels&hl=en&gl=us"},"path.of.evil.immortal.hunter.dungeon.rpg":{"title":"Path of Evil: Immortal Hunter","description":"Path of Evil: Immortal Hunter is an action RPG hack and slash inspired by the greatest old school games.\\n\\n***CLASSIC ACTION RPG GAME - HACK AND SLASH***\\n\u2022 Hack and slash your way through hordes of terrible monsters.\\n\u2022 Slash and loot and upgrade your equipment with sacred items to get ready for the final battle with the devil.\\n\u2022 Classic action RPG mechanics, your skills will be your only ally to defeat your enemies!\\n\\n***EXCITING BOSS FIGHTS***\\n\u2022 Endless hack and slash, go dungeon hunter and slay them all!\\n\u2022 3 Dungeon boss on every floor, evil creatures from exile.\\n\u2022 2 Secret levels leading to the exiled kingdoms of divinity.\\n\\n***DARK FANTASY ENVIRONMENT***\\nPath of evil brings amazing special effects and a dark fantasy atmosphere that will accompany you through this hack and slash adventure.\\nGo down and explore the abyss with your Immortal dungeon hunter, kill evil demons and then challenge your skills in the boss fight!

The main issue is, you have some abilities but your mainly just auto attacking thru the same dungeon against the same enemies, in act one that is. I can see that the following acts will probably be more of the same. Needs more player interaction rather just running to enemies to auto attack, using a spell when you have mana then running away when you don\'t.","It\'s new, beautiful, but the combat is a little off. I\'ll edit as I proceed through the game. I\'m trying to be nice with my rating, but I\'m disliking the combat system. Update: It\'s bad, there are no class systems, or combat control of melee. It\'s very automatic. Not much fun or sense of playing. I\'ll update as I go further, It was three stars, now it\'s two.","Iv been waiting for this to drop!

It be awesome if you can combine items that change the character with different items, also chose what character you want, know this is in early release but cant wait to see this game grow! You devs doing a good job! Keep it up.","Was really hopeful with this one. You guys, you need to make it so that the models change when people equip items. Also just spamming the same mobs over and over again so that people will watch ads when they die is not okay. I know you guys didn\'t do any levels really, but if you need my help you need only ask and I\'ll help you with the story.","Mediocre at best. You got a good premise with a good style but you are SEVERELY lacking in playability... Everything free is for ads, if the ads dont freeze on you, and you cant get rid of the ads even with a purchase... Dont bother purchasing though, you can buy GREAT items to \\"help\\" you but even if you upgrade them everything still gets harder as you get stronger.

Also, the need to build up rage points puts a damper on the battles. Then, the first couple times I played I didn\'t have any issues, but now the game keeps shutting down like there\'s a resolution conflict. Still a pretty good adventure side-scroller.","I can\'t give this game enough compliments. Every single aspect of this game has been nailed by the creators, except for one oversight. Late in the game and story, it begins to become a chore to play. For casual and intermediate players, the late game battles are too difficult. You also might find yourself like me, stuck in a quest where I have to defeat difficult enemies before I can go anywhere, and unable to without endless grinding. It\'s really unfortunate, because I loved this game a lot.","Single best mobile game. It\'s absolutely worth the $5 to unlock the full version and the Dark Harvest game mode. The story mode is amazing with a great balance of fun and challenge. The story itself isn\'t slacking either. I lost my old account and repurchased it as soon as I could. I recommend this to anyone and EVERYONE. No other game has come close to keeping me invested this long. 10/10!","Disgustingly in love with this game. It\'s my favorite little time killer. Absolutely worth $5. Thr storyline is simple but interesting enough to keep attention, and going on a killing spree in dark harvest mode is a good minor stress reliever. Controls are simple enough to remember. And the graphics are well done and very cute.","This game is great. I played it back in 2014-ish and loved it. Just recently remembered it and redownloaded and it\'s just as fun this time around. Very aesthetic and stylish. Character design is awesome, and the controls are easy to pick up. The degree of difficulty increases naturally the further into the game you go. Some levels actually get quite challenging and take multiple tries to beat. The game is a great time killer. I recommend buying the full game.

An ad every single time you have to switch between kingdom map and world map which is very often. 2. Extremely imbalanced, no way can an enemy ai troop of 300 beat a troop of 700 with defenses. 3. The resources balance is also off, I can have 3 mines and it still takes dam forever to get any metal at all.

The game is good, have potential. It\'s a RTS game, where you build, then you can explore a global map where other AI or player\'s village. However, the game need to improve, choosing, controlling each unit is hard, it\'s always been too late moving my infantries in front of my archer. And I can\'t seems to aim enemies troops, I can only move mine close to them then they will auto attack.","Giving 5 star this rts has potential I remember playing praetorians in pc pretty similar with it , just Add more option in setting like the graphics 60fps option anti-aliasing and many more , I love to see future update with more option I hope the developer do something.","It is a good game.

A simple game idea that can surely be expanded. It would be cool if we had different ways to train other than the tennis balls, or have our rounds back-to-back so we wouldn\'t have to train multiple times. It would also be awesome if we could control our champ in battle so the game would be more based on fighting game skill instead of fruit ninja skill. One more thing I want to add just because I feel like it: Ember is cute\u2764","I love this game! Its great. Ember is my most favorite fighter in the game. But one thing i have to comment on is the actual fighting itself. I am not a fan of the automatic fighting. Being a big fighting game guy, I would greatly prefer if this game had manual fighting instead of the automatic fighting it has now. But other than that, everything else is great! Amazing game!","Great game, but I have two problems. One, there\'s no instruction on how to fight or block, so every fight is pretty much luck based. Two, whenever I try to connect to Facebook, it says the game doesn\'t have the right settings for it, thus preventing me from having my progress being saved.","Dont get me wrong this is a great game. I truly enjoy it, but I just bought some armor. The chest piece and pants piece and I lose one fight and it disappeared off my character and now I have to re-buy them. Which I find totally bullcrap","I gotta say, I like this game. However, I do have a few notes... My biggest issue: Why is there only one female character? Can you add more characters, so we can really choose? Next, I wanna say the training part is good and all, but I\'d like it better if it altered our stats, rather than determine the outcome of the match. And, preferably I\'d like to have the match be playable, rather than having to rely on our skills in the training. I don\'t like watching the game, I prefer actually playing."],"appId":"com.kiloo.smashchamps","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kiloo.smashchamps&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.oddyarts.StoneOfLifeEXNative":{"title":"S.O.L : Stone of Life EX","description":"Best Old School RPG!\\nBest Offline RPG for android!\\n\\nStylish Action RPG!

But, after a certain point points for enemies go to 1. There are pop_up tips that disappear before you can read them. Could not find any instructions or information on how to play or points earned and how to assign them. I have reached a point where it is all but impossible to clear dungeons without having to purchase additional items.","This is a great game, however it is not possible to save your progress and reinstall the game, or to have your progress saved so that you can upgrade your device. That is a big problem since purchases are wasted each time. i would like my progress restored, my purchases refunded, or at the very least all the purchased gems be restored, now that i need to start over.","I like this game just fine. The only problem I have is the lack of cloud saves. I recently got a new phone and wanted to migrate my game data to it. but when I try to connect to Facebook to save to the cloud, Facebook says the game is still in developement mode and that I don\'t have access to it. I\'ve played this game for a couple of years now, so how can it still be in developement mode? I am NOT starting over! That means I lose all the levels and gear I have accumulated if I install it on my new phone?! I would normally rate this game 4-5 stars, but losing all my progress lowers it to a 2!","Interesting item drops, rivals Diablo 2 in that respect. Some agonizing equipment choices keeps hak and slashers interesting. Good skill array, too. Spent money on legend gear and identification, upgrade, and enhancement items on another device long ago, don\'t really need them all that much if I feel like grinding, which is good since I can\'t get to that game on a different device.","This is exactly the game I\'ve been searching for. It has amazing graphics, I absolutely love the way the characters move and the way they perform attacks. The only issue I have with this game is how much time it takes for the character to attack. I\'m used to spamming the attack button, so I guess I\'m not used to moving that slowly yet. Everything about this game is amazing! 10/10, I would definently recommend this game to anyone who love fast paced, action rpgs!"],"appId":"com.oddyarts.StoneOfLifeEXNative","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.oddyarts.StoneOfLifeEXNative&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.sixmonkeys.tap.hero.idle.rpg.game":{"title":"Tap Dungeon Hero-Idle RPG Game","description":"Tap Dungeon Hero-Idle RPG Game the best action adventure idle RPG game of 2022.\ud83d\udd25\\n\\n\u2756 The Story Of Tap Dungeon Hero:Idle Infinity RPG Game \u2756\\nThe dungeon is overrun by monsters and needs a hero to save it.

Lots of fun features, but there is definitely a short-term advantage to spending money (for tournaments and such). The Abyss seems like a bit of a thirsty move on behalf of the devs, but there\'s really only so much you can do with a casual clicker. Overall a very fun experience if you\'re bored every once in a while, but constant playing will burn you out if you need new content all the time.","Enjoyable game, only been playing a couple of hours. The game holds your hand in the beginning and explains the core mechanic\'s well.","I like it. Id suggest making it when you upgrade heroes and you want to upgrade by 100, only highlight heroes that can do 100","I started playing a few days ago and now i can\'t stop. Its addicting but in a good way. I recommend this game as it is definitely one of the best clicker games and more.","Well Good Job Game Dev, You Made A Game That Crashes Instantly.

I love the RuneScape inspired nature of the game and the fact that the business model is actually fair. However, the experience is very bare bones in certain ways. For example, instead of just having one \\"shop\\" menu for everything you can buy I\'d love to see some sort of central hub town (like early Adventurequest) with some art work, NPCs, and multiple shops to go to, even if it\'s just all menu based.","I was really tempted on giving it 5 stars but there\'s a huge issue with players that go from playing the pc version to the mobile version, the ui in the cloud save menu can be very dissonanting when you look at it the first few times and it caused me to completely lose a save on both platforms. There should just be a system where you sign into an account and BAM, you have your characters on both platforms easy to access. Other than that best idle game ever.","This is a nearly perfect idle game. It is chocked so full of great ideas, and with some hundred hours in, I\'m still learning. My only gripe is that the combat screen could use a little rework there is too much data and is a little difficult to find what you need sometimes. Also sometimes when you collect a lot of loot at once, it should group your loot in the in-game notifications, instead of doing 100 individual ones, causing lag.","I\'ve had months of entertainment with this game, the best idle I\'ve played. Unlike others, this game actually let\'s you feel like you\'re progressing without the need or option for micro transactions. And there are so many options to progress in. A great game to just set and come back to once or twice a day to check progress or change your action. My only issue is the game gets very laggy and temp freezes somewhat often.","I love the concept of the game, and it has a lot going for it. The RuneScape nostalgia is palpable. However, it seems to need a lot of optimizations behind the scenes, because it is very laggy, whether opening a menu, clicking a button, or trying to buy/sell something. I had to change all the settings of confirmation boxes and item acquisition notifications just to reduce it to a playable state, and even without then I have a lot of latency. Without the lag it would be 5/5 easy."],"appId":"com.malcs.melvoridle","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.malcs.melvoridle&hl=en&gl=us"},"ninja.creed.sniper.real3d.action.free.android":{"title":"Ninja\u2019s Creed:3D Shooting Game","description":"Ninja\u2019s Creed is one of free fun 3D real sniper shooting games with various types of  assassin weapons.

When it comes to getting the free runes (through ads) I\'ve had two ads pop-up back to back or the game glitches and closes out. When it closes, I don\'t get credit for the ad and sometimes lose an ad token. However, ads that require in game currency don\'t glitch. It makes it worse when the game has forced ads. I have to re-log into the game after every arena match and mission. I\'ve ran the game on wifi and 5G, same issue","Awesome so far. Stunning graphics. Smooth play, even on my prehistoric Galaxy S9+. No crashes. Takes up reasonable space on phone considering the unbelievable graphics you get to enjoy. Game offers a ton of stuff to do but with no long tedious tutorials. You can jump right in and start enjoying all that game has to offer. No real ad issues. Every-so-often upgrade offers, but not in-your-face-forced harassment. Soundtrack is there in the background but not overbearing. \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50","Ninja\'s Creed I really enjoy; in a short time its made my list of fav\'s, however the game will suddenly stop and go to the beginning page. It does this each and every time I play, yet that as much of a bummer as it is cant keep me from enjoying it. It would be very apreciated if this glitch we\'re fixed. Aside from that I\'d like to see it redeveloped in the near future thank you, you guys rock...","Not usually into shooters, but this one is addicting as hell. Love it, can\'t stop playing.... Everything runs real smooth. The rewards for ads are good and I can skip an ad altogether hrt if I want. Keep this game running this smooth and it\'ll go far. P.s. more weapons would be nice or personal player construction and customizing would be a good way to get more on depth with it.","Game play is fun, and you can grind to advance without paying to win, which is nice. It would be a 5 star review except for the fact that the last two updates have caused the app to crash when playing or crashing when trying to open the app. Turning on airplane mode helps briefly, but the app will crash at some point with or without an internet connection."],"appId":"ninja.creed.sniper.real3d.action.free.android","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ninja.creed.sniper.real3d.action.free.android&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.studiowildcard.wardrumstudios.ark":{"title":"ARK: Survival Evolved","description":"***PLEASE NOTE: This game is officially supported only on touchscreen Android devices with at least 3 GB of RAM and up-to-date Vulkan support.

However, unless you have a really good phone you chop alot and get kicked often even on the lowest settings. Also, the game saves are not practical. It will save, then 10 seconds later save again. However, at times it won\'t save for over 20 mins forcing you to manually save. Also, if you get kicked after a quest completion and forget to save when you log back in the quest is gone and so is the reward from your inventory.","Great game but after a certain point you will constantly crash, sometimes not even 30 seconds after logging back in. In the beginning you will never crash but mid-late game it\'s almost impossible to play. I even deleted everything on my phone but ark mobile is just broken. Most of the audio for half the map is just non existent, which kills all the suspense and fun. Maybe it\'s my phone, but I doubt it. Other than that, I love the game. Might have to stick to console though.","I Love Ark. I played this game in my console. The phone version is quite laggy. The sound is crackling every move you make. It\'s really hard to maneuver your character bcuz of the control set up. Is there a setting where you can have fix controller button to move your character rather than having to tap here and there or everywhere in your phone screen? It\'ll be helpful. Thanks","Amazing survival game! I love the fact that there\'s always something to do, and it\'s full of different creatures to encounter. But it does crash every now and then, (at times it will be a continuous thing depending on the actions you make, but usually doesn\'t last very long) besides that, it\'s a great game and I would recommend it for anyone who\'s into survival/dinosaurs. Edit: changed my previous review since they fixed the problem I kept running into. Thank you Wildcard, keep up the good work.","An absolutely amazing game.

I had this game for over two years and played it off and on when I wanted something different, I had deleted it long ago and reloaded it. BIG MISTAKE, not only could not reload previous purchases but all levels accomplished were gone, and after trying to connect to get my account via FB I was told that its not possible...","DO NOT INSTALL! I REPEAT DO NOT INSTALL! I bought this game and played it one day, I spent about $20 or maybe $30 on it and it was going fine I was enjoying it and everything but then the next day I tried logging in to play but it would just freeze l couldn\'t even move around in the main menu like to the armory or see the leaderboard. This happens with games a lot, you play them once but they never load again and this is one of those games, also very repetitive, the map doesn\'t change. DEVS FIX!","It\'s really good, love the way it looks and the satisfaction of a clean kill. The only issue is whenever I re-enter the game after a while, it freezes at the homepage and doesn\'t let me play or do anything. It\'s a hassle to get into the game but the game itself is great. Would change to 5 stars if this issue was fixed \ud83d\udc4d","Like others, opening app for second time breaks it permanently. It was a cool game but the second time I tried to play, the screen would load but couldn\'t click anything. Closed and reopened, force closed and reopened, cleared cache, cleared data, uninstalled and reinstalled. Nothing fixes it. The game becomes completely non-functional.","Changing review from 5 stars to 1. Like many others were saying, it could be a great game, but it only works the very first time you play. After that first time, any attempt to re-enter the game gives a notification prompt, then freezes the game. Uninstalling and reinstalling causes even more issues. Clearing the cache does nothing. If the devs would fix this, it would be an awesome game, but it seems like they don\'t care. They don\'t acknowledge anyone\'s reviews. Good thing it only cost a dollar"],"appId":"com.squareenixmontreal.hitmansniperandroid","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.squareenixmontreal.hitmansniperandroid&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.ftt.eroica.gl.aos":{"title":"Eroica","description":"More than just an adventure in search of fate and truth!

Great 3D animation and designs all around. Really fits the atmosphere they are trying to show from the games identity. The requirements are a bit high though. This in turn bring a few glitches to the game. Such as a double screen after loading from the cafe. As well as, freezing on some story progression. Please fix this if possible.","This is a 5 star game. BUT my issue is that you guys make some things unnecessarily difficult even with tutorials available to assist the player. While I did figure it out on my own, you need to make going to places such as 1-10 to 1-11 more obvious. That yellow \\"Q\\" doesn\'t really stick out well. While the game itself should be challenging, it should not be challenging to figure out how to progress yourself in the game. Please make it easier to figure out where you need to go on the map.","After playing for a few days I\'ve a better feel for this game. It\'s pretty fun but I docked another start for two reasons. First is that when your adventure you have to pay attention and click on background elements to get rewards. Second is the stupid recruitment system that requires 100% attendance for a month to get the chosen hero. I despise that mechanic and it\'s likely why I\'ll end up dropping this.","I could get past the lag and the discord link being cut off by the screen so I can\'t receive the reward. What I can\'t get past is the greed. There aren\'t microtransactions in this game, instead they want to charge you 25 USD for a 10 summon. I can buy 2 or 3 games on Steam for that price. All of the shop prices are insanely expensive. What a way to ruin a game that could\'ve been great.","I\'m really enjoying the game and characters, but this game seems to be overheating my phone. I\'m playing on a OnePlus 7pro and as soon as I play for a few minutes my phone gets dangerously hot.

No forced ads which is incredible, and the waves feel fun, and yet each new wave is a different challenge. I would give it 5 stars except for two things: 1. There are 3 attacks that are almost the exact same, and 2. The run is often determined by luck. It would be super awesome if there was a way to get more than 3 choices, and also while cool, the skill tree gets repetitive. These are all very minor things and overall the game is a great experience.","I would love to give this game five stars because the gameplay is very simple yet fun, the enemies and items all seem balances and fair, and there are barely any ads. However unfortunately it suffers from one major weakness. It crashes. A lot. Just recently as I started playing the trial levels for chapter two I haven\'t been able to get past the second stage because the level always crashes before I can complete it. It\'s a new game, so hopefully these issues will be fixed in an update.","Overall good fun, with a good mix of tactics, reaction and luck. Does get a bit repetitive, however, especially as a single level often takes 15 minutes to complete. And if you get unlucky and get a few bad rolls on your weapons/supplies, you may have to start over. Also, the screen starts to fill up too much in the \'late game\' when you have everything maxed out and are shooting 6 different weapons constantly. It makes it almost impossible to see enemies.","Challenging, but amazing fun. I honestly expected this to be another ad powered casual game that I would play for a few days and then quit when the ads got to my nerves. Instead, it\'s a semi intense game of luck and strategy, action and discovery that really keeps me invested. The ads are there, but you chose when to watch and they\'re worth it. Overall, it\'s fun for anyone looking for an engaging experience.","Good but with noticeable bugs. This game is fun, however, the most noticeable bug that I have run into is that enemies have completely random percentage changes in their damage as the time progresses. Had to edit this review as this had only occured two of the first three times I played this. It hasn\'t happened since and so I imagine it could have been an odd, phone issue. Since it hasn\'t occurred again, I will adjust my rating to 5 stars - as this is a good game!"],"appId":"com.dxx.firenow","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dxx.firenow&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.ninjakiwi.sasza4":{"title":"SAS: Zombie Assault 4","description":"Purge the undead!

Earn glory for your faction and pick up some awesome rewards in the process. What are you waiting for? Let&#39;s move out! ","comments":["A very enjoyable game; that being said, there are a few issues/suggestions I have. The first one is that I feel high-level strongboxes are too hard to get (I do like the strongbox mechanic, just maybe a rarity rebalancing or something). Also, multiplayer games feel slightly unstable at times, and I do wish there was singleplayer nightmare mode. I would recommend it, it is a lot of fun especially to play in short bursts, and it\'s nice there\'s a singleplayer option as well.","If you factor in the cheapest in-game purchase of $2.50 to remove ads, this is a really nice game for the price. It\'s on multiple platforms, all cross compatible and still being updated after I think a decade. It has tons of play time and I appreciate the story and map design. It\'s definitely been refined, and has few bugs compared to a lot of mobile games. A nice take on a serious top down apocalyptic RPG. I would recommend it.","First off, they finally updated the game. I thought it was abandoned since 2015, but they updated it! They actually listened! I don\'t want to be greedy, but there are some things they could fix since they are back. Players are constantly disconnecting. If everyone disconnects during a last man standing, it fails it and you get no place on the event board. Me and this guy were the last 2, and he left before I won. Instead of giving me the win, it gave me no board placement. Last man is unplayable","I think this game is amazing but to top it off you need to make it where you can add Friends and play with them for all events and multiplayer aspects and more ways to talk to your team. It would be incredible but other than that keep the game alive with new content. It\'s could climb to the top of the charts incredibly fast. Keep continue to keep the game alive","I used to play this years ago. Redownloaded it and was so happy to see that all of my data was still backed up AND the game is still live. 3 different classes with unique abilities and perks, countless weapons, armor pieces and augments for both weapons and armor make the possibilities endless. Deploy turrets to assist you against the zombie hordes, play solo, with friends or randoms in classic SAS 3 style missions or special events that change every day. This game has always been a blast. 5\u2606"],"appId":"com.ninjakiwi.sasza4","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ninjakiwi.sasza4&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.square_enix.android_googleplay.WOTVffbeww":{"title":"FINAL FANTASY BE:WOTV","description":"In the latest work of the FINAL FANTASY BRAVE EXVIUS series, experience a battle that has remained unknown in the world of FFBE...until now.\\n\\nCharacters from past FINAL FANTASY titles will be included!\\n\\nTwin princes and the beautiful steel maiden\u2014\\nThe War of the Visions begins! \\n\\n\u2022 ---------------------------------------- \u2022\\n\u3000\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Gameplay\\n\u2022 ---------------------------------------- \u2022\\nExperience the stories of each kingdom and its warriors on the continent of Ardra by exploring Story Quests, World Quests, Event Quests, and more.\\nCooperate with other players to progress in Multiplayer Quests, or compete online via Duel.\\n\\n\uff1cBattle System\uff1e\\nThe pinnacle of tactical battles, presented in 3D terrains with various elevations.

The auto-play AI is pretty good. However the in-battle UI needs work, simply telling a unit to move to a square is a pain. There\'s no transparency for terrain so you need to rotate the camera whenever there\'s a hill/tree, no recognition for squares you can\'t move to (e.g. occupied by another unit), and switching to top-down view spins the map to a pre-set orientation, with no icons distinguish units other than the tops of their 3d models.","My favorite gacha style games are more than just card games and random draws for jpegs and gifs. The ones that hook me the most are ones with interesting gameplay that reproduce the feeling of its source material. I say all that to qualify that this game has done an amazing job adapting final fantasy tactics to mobile. I have FFT but can\'t stand the controls. FFBEWOTV has a great story, and feels like FFT without the clunky ported PS1 controls. Also, they added Tifa.","I really like the game but they need to make the characters from different final fantasies Cross overs more Available within a reasonable amount of time . If you get a character from a different final fantasy, It take forever for the character To become available again. If they finally come back around an you did not get to level the character up They are stuck at that same level because you can\'t get the character shards anymore or the materials needed for Items to advance in thier levels.","The Story is great, better than what was expected from a mobile game. There is a ton of content that can keep you busy for a while. The real down sides come down to the interface, because there is so much to do expecally if you are new it feels like you have no idea where to start. There is so much to collect, Units, Weapons, Visions, Crafting items, it gets bit much. The worst part is the Gatcha system though, I spent $100 to attempt to get Bahamut and nothing.","Happy to get Lara, but not happy that the game crashed during my unit summons. Also the game crashes randomly for weeks with no fixes. I can\'t stay on game long enough to play it. Can\'t do my guild leader duties, can\'t do event quests,and game crashes as i leveling or change units equipment, etc. It makes the over all experience not fun. My mobile phone is more than capable to run the game app, the latest Android, 5gb ram, and plenty of storage space.

I\'ve had crashes before but now it\'s just ridiculous especially with the last 2 updates. I can\'t even load it up. It just turns off in the black loading page. It might start up once every 10 tries, which sometimes that doesn\'t work. Once I get it started by luck, it crashes and shuts down again soon after when I go to change the page or something. Absolutely impossible to play anymore.","Unable to even open the game as it crashes immediately had this problem for about a week now and from what I\'ve seen this has been a problem for a long time. I\'ve spent hundreds of dollars in this game and am well built in it, I can\'t grind or even use my stamina this needs to be fixed immediately :Edit- I dropped this game as it was never fixed constantly crashes making it unplayable and here I am again and the game is STILL unplayable! This is just ridiculous! It\'s like the devs don\'t care!","Decent game, play on steam though. Andorid version keeps crashing as of the latest update there needs to be a patch that fixes this as I can\'t even get past the title screen. This is a problem for many players on mobile. The steam version is more stable so use that one instead if you want to play. Buying gems are expsenive. F2p is possible this game if you grind for it. Gameplay is fun, spritework and art is great and the animations are quality. Bugs need to be fixed though as rn its unplayable","Edit: I really like this game, I wish there was a proper Disgaea game with a comparable roster, but every update is a nightmare trying to find enough space. Some of the new features are neat, but I feel like the point of a mobile game is missed and too much data is dedicated to one of several pass schemes trying to get blood from a stone. Even though I like it better than one game I have on my phone, I had to drop this one because that\'s just kicking the can down the road with the space problem.","I want to point out that this is NOT a tactics RPG like the mainline Disgaea games, it\'s an auto battler. However, everything else is on point! I waited on this one for a while, because - and I don\'t mean this in a hurtful way - a LOT of Boltrend\'s games, particularly their licensed titles, have quality problems. Translation errors still pop up in places but the main story so far has been consistent, and it\'s been very easy to get up to speed with all the first time player extras I\'ve gotten."],"appId":"com.boltrend.disgaea.en","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.boltrend.disgaea.en&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.notdoppler.earntodie2":{"title":"Earn to Die 2","description":"Drive your car through a zombie apocalypse in this massive follow-up to the chart-topping hit Earn to Die!\\n\\nAn evacuation ship is waiting on the other side of the country.

An ad would pop up after 3-4 runs, no biggie. But now it\'s after every run, and these ads have 3 screens to close most of the time. It\'s nuts, and the game is SO good. I played through it years ago before this insane ad culture whatever appeared. Such a bummer...","This game is awesome. I just beat it at just under 500 days. I like that the game is beatable without having to pay for things. I watched a ton of ads though for extra money. The amount of forced ads to playing is amazingly balanced. The only thing I do not like is that every cars strength and power is the same. I think that when the cars get bigger and more powerful the obstacles should become bigger and stronger. My tiny starter car should not blast through the same as the giant dump truck.","loads of fun! Game isnt so easy or dull that I delefed it after one day, but also not too difficult that it gets frustrating. The action and graphics are fun and exciting. Like all free games, there are commercials after each course, but the courses are long enough that you dont feel like you spend more time on ads than you do on the actual game. two thumbs up!","This has to be the most replayable game i\'ve installed (& reinstalled). i played 1 & 2 in highschool 8 years ago and still occasionally play. The controls are accurate. Each time you go back in you can go through a different route, and can always improve your distance, with good strategy. This game always keeps me entertained and i would rate 6 stars if possible. And if i could beg the devs to make a third, i\'d do it 100 times. Highly recommend!","Games sorta fun. It gets a bit boring. After every 3 stopping points, you get a new car. Can\'t use the previous one so you\'re stuck with a slow, unupgraded car yet again. It\'s pretty much rinse and repeat. If you don\'t feel like playing, you get much more money watching adds than you would actually playing so if you want to get through the boring parts, do that."],"appId":"com.notdoppler.earntodie2","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.notdoppler.earntodie2&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.babeltimeus.legendstd":{"title":"Realm Defense: Hero Legends TD","description":"Defenders!

Levels become harder as progress. But still fun since this allows play offline, great option when there\'s no wifi available. And they have more worlds and levels too now. Too many complain need buy gems but so far have been doing just fine playing it free. They give you enough gems to save up for heroes (just depends which you choose). This app is frustrating that it occasionally crashes before it launches. So just beware and save progress.","I\'ve been playing at a steady pace for months. Very fun and enjoyable, lots of things to expand to keep the game fun. A tad slower than I\'d perfer, and sometimes you need certain characters to get through levels, or it will be very difficult. That\'s the worst feature, as these characters cost a lot of in game currency that I\'d rather spend elsewhere. All in all though, about as solid a tower defense game you could ask for, I\'d try it out if I were you! :)","This game is a lot of fun. Engaging mechanics and fun heroes. However, the cost of advancement is very steep. The cash prices for heroes and resources are very high, and the rate of gain for crystals is WAY too slow. The recently added achievements are broken for experienced players. Many of them cannot be completed without starting a new account. Please fix this issue!","As the game continued to add features (which is great), it consistently locked many of said features behind pay walls (which is awful). Moreover, it began to make even basic functions (such as progression, leveling, etc.) pay-walled, unless you don\'t playing for 5 minutes daily for months just to accumulate what you would need. Sad, as I played this game when it was first released and it had so much potential, to the point where I wouldn\'t mind investing. Now, it\'s simply too expensive.","Fun tower-defense game. Not pay-to-win. Customer service is slow but good. The game definitely gets more challenging as I go along, which is great. It seems a bit overly complicated. For example, each of your heroes has a level and a rank and abilities and \\"awakenings\\" to level up. I guess that\'s for people who play for months and need a little more to do."],"appId":"com.babeltimeus.legendstd","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.babeltimeus.legendstd&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.loadcomplete.mergedefense":{"title":"Merge Tactics: Kingdom Defense","description":"Merge Tactics is a unique defense game filled with elements of growth, strategy, and challenge.\\nIt lets you place blocks wherever you want, based on whatever fighting strategy you use.\\n\\nGame Features\\nCreate Your Own Battle Decks and Strategies\\n- You need different decks and strategies to effectively deal with the various invaders that attack your forces. \\n- Every time you clear a wave, you\'ll get to expand your territory on the battlefield and employ even more diverse defense strategies.\\nMerge Blocks into More Powerful Units\\n- In this game, one can be stronger than two\u2014even three!

I don\'t know. I guess it didn\'t look very appealing, at first... It\'s actually rather addictive. Requires good strategy to stop the onslaught of enemy barreling down on you, and the ability to change it on the fly. Play is technically turn based, but not slow paced, as you might think it would be. F2p is totally possible, but I personally won\'t have an issue spending a few dollars on a game that absolutely deserves it, like this one. Thanks, devs!","I\'ve played a few different games like this one. And it\'s basically a strategic matching tower defense. You can only merge the same units. And they must have the same level. And your only goal is to defeat the waves of enemies before they get to your commander. The ability to play offline is a nice addition, and it\'s a simple game with advanced quick thinking to outmaneuver the tetris like waves. I\'d recommend it to any tower defense, and/or tetris fans.","The gameplay is simple and intuitive, your strategies must evolve as you progress through the game. The upgrade system is well developed and metered. Resources are scarce enough you can\'t max everything too quickly but plentiful enough you dont have to grind. It\'s a fun, exciting, & challenging game! The graphics are great stylistically for the type of game it is. All in all it\'s a 10/10, keep up the great work guys, I look forward to your future releases and Ill download them all!","Solid foundation for great game. It\'s engaging both in its gameplay and art design, but also has depth of strategy and a potential for very strong late game. 5 stars to help support it and hope to see some improvements. Please improve UI. Add option to filter/sort/more easily compare blocks and teams. Please add option for more team slots, I\'d even be okay paying. More game modes, or progress tracks. Just need more ways to play and more data. Good game as is, room to be better.","Fun, cute game with simple mechanics. Very generous with rewards and has optional ads that don\'t get in your way, which is great, in my book. There\'s also NO ENERGY/STAMINA keeping you from playing the game (except for the Challenge mode, and Endless mode can be replayed by watching an ad). My one criticism is that I\'d like to see a game mode that does something different from the others. Something to break the formula.

The more you level up, more options to play different things open up! Alot of free stuff given out too. You can make purchases for a reasonable price too! So much to do here that I keeps me busy daily. So if u feel like it doesn\'t have enough games to fight.....u haven\'t leveled up enough \ud83d\ude43 \ud83d\ude42","Very fun game, though it might have p2w features competing as a f2p player while might be hard and require quite a lot of determination it\'s still in an acceptable area. The overall aspect of the game is pretty simple and honestly I like it better than IT right now! Plus the game has ample options at the beginning to get you jump started if you\'re a bit late in joining a server. Overall I recommend if you\'re casual or not.","The game is a fun way to pass the time, the chat function in game is a little buggy, but from what I understand it\'s because of the auto translate feature. Some of the words get covered by other images would if fixed would be helpful. I would rate this higher, but the game crashed when I made a purchase and took the payment but didn\'t give me my items, I reached out to the in game support, it took a bit but the issue was taken care of.","The game is decent, in many ways it feels like a modded version of IT. It definitely feels more user friendly with a bunch of minor nitpicks from IT fixed or improved. There\'s still plenty of translation problems but it\'s playable and they seem open to suggestions. Major problem for me is that when I try buying bundles etc it brings up a screen for jade of the same price and charges me but I don\'t receive anything and character limits seem very small in text boxes making contacting support hard.","Overall it\'s a decent, relaxing tap gaming experience. If you want to level up quickly you do have to sink money into it, but it\'s optional and can go for the lengthier grind Issue I would have is the games aspect ratio, my text runs off the screen so I can\'t see requirements for the next sect level up 5-6"],"appId":"com.windforce.wjxt.fanti","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.windforce.wjxt.fanti&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.hidea.cat":{"title":"Cats & Soup - Cute idle Game","description":"\u2665Us cute catz hav arrived hooman!\u2665\\n<2021 Google Play Indie Games Festival TOP3 Selected Game>\\n\\nLooking for a cute cat game?\\nHere is a peaceful animal forest where cats boil their delicious soup!\\nAn idle relaxing cat game perfect for cat moms and dads  =\u272a \u11ba \u272a=\\n\\n1.

It does feel that way sometimes but if you could just beat the game instantly what would be the point. No forced ads is amazing. You can watch them to speed up progression. The only thing is I wish they would lower the cost of changing a Cats ability. I watch enough ads to bring in revenue and with such a high chance for lower star rating and so many options it is hard to get cats with the correct skill and high stars. 250-300 per resetplease","This game is adorable. It was fun in the first couple days of playing but after building about 8 things, I would watch an ad for coins every time the chance popped up. It\'s annoying. I also have to level up my things so I would have less money so I\'d have to watch more ads. Ehm it just got boring and repetitive with me going absolutely nowhere. I am uninstalling it but it was cute while it lasted.","I want to like this so much. But as many have said : TOO MANY ADS. I\'m sick of watching ads for games or apps I\'ll never in a million years download. Also, after you pass the C coin level, it\'s pretty much impossible to level up. Its basically an ad app at this point because I can\'t level. I want to enjoy this because it was so fun at first. Now I might just uninstall it since I won\'t be getting any new stations anytime soon.","This game is absolutely adorable and so fun to play! It is heavy on ads but they\'re strictly opt in which is nice. My only complaint is it would be nice to have two separate options for upgrading by one level and another option to upgrade by 10 levels. I\'m a bit weird about even numbers so it bothers me when I\'m forced to upgrade more than I wanted to."],"appId":"com.hidea.cat","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hidea.cat&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.spcomes.esabyss":{"title":"Abyss : Rebirth Phantom","description":"\u25c8 Enjoy the Idle game X RPG X Cute girls(Bishojyo) at once!\\nYou don\'t have to play for a long time.

The character art is very well made and the pixel art isn\'t bad either. However, whenever I watch an ad and return to the game, the game starts lagging like crazy. There isn\'t a graphics option so I\'m forced to close and reopen the game whenever I watch an ad for anything. Hopefully this can be fixed. Other than that, I\'m enjoying it","Fairly straight forward. Lots of ways to get free diamonds as long as you have patience and lot of clicking through characters. Game progression gets slow after first couple episodes. Offline does not seem to register correctly as stages does not progress the supposed amount. Needs balancing to make the game seem like there\'s more progression/interest.","Fun game. But for the love of my sanity change back to the previous ad networks you used. I\'m sick and tired of all these scam \'make money quick\' ads. It\'s to the point where I will quit the game every 20 seconds just so I don\'t watch it for any of the ad rewards. Hell, if there was a way to pay $5 to remove ads I\'d do that","Well, I\'ve been playing the game for 1 month now and just got my 30-day login reward. The game is fun for the first 2 weeks, then progression becomes slower and slower as you rebirth and upgrade your heroes. It\'s been an entire month and I\'m still on level 4000, the game goes up to 12000. I like the fact that it\'s not hard to get diamonds, but the odds of gettin 4 or 5 stars characters are pretty low, but that\'s not an issue. It\'s a good game but the progression system needs a rework.","This game is okay so far, but it has tons of freezing, delayed response and it does have a few typos. Thanks for the game, hope you can fix these issues! Thanks in advance~ Hi, it\'s me again, just wanted to let you know that this game is freezing really badly.

The graphics, the gameplay, the sounds are good, except some sounds, for example, when you complete a mission, that sound isn\'t good for this game. The interface have so many things, it looks bad. The interface can be improved, for example when you go near of a character, the button to talk to him looks no good. The first cinematic when you start playing, at the end, the background looks bad. And I suggest one thing, dead sounds variations will be good.","Love this game ... It\'s hard to grind up the items needed to upgrade certin guns or animals and equally hard to gain the items that equip to ur person ...one thing I was wishing to b able to do was upgrade the abilities the person has ... Make them stronger by them selves .. other than that ... Great game... though also the vehicle is a bit hard to stear out of the way of lots of things ...","Fairly good rpg, I am removing a star however due to the forced screen orientation. It forced me to play the game in upside-down orientation on my tablet, which requires me to remove it from its dock. Other than this, what is to me an unnecessary feature, the game is decent and otherwise we\'ll crafted. Orientation probably is not as big a concern for phone players. Good game.","Overall ok game.

I admit, at first.. I thought it was totally lame.. But it only took me about 3 minutes to realize.. \'OK.. Maybe I was wrong.\' IT\'S FANTASTIC! Perfect for someone like me who has a hard time meditating my way out of being anxious.. It\'s the perfect distraction to focus my mind & relax so I can either get some sleep, or get on with my day. Since I started playing it.. My anxiety went from a 9 down to a more manageable 3 in less than 20 minutes.","An absolutely fantastic game. Beautiful graphics, even when simplistic. The puzzles start of easy and get more difficult as you progress. They never are impossible, you just need to think and try different permutations. The puzzles also change movements to keep your interest. And excellent game that is worth playing. You won\'t be sorry.","I can agree with these other reviews. Amazing game with beautiful pictures. I\'m not sure what the story is, but maybe it doesn\'t need one. It\'s beautiful as is. Music is fantastic, and as for the bugs and glitches, I have experienced the invisible puzzle piece glitch a couple of times. And sometimes the exit to level select button doesn\'t work. But other that, great game!","Very nice sliding puzzle game. Minimalist graphics -- which is not a bad thing at all here. The game music is gorgeous. The puzzles each have their own logic. In the earlier levels, the puzzles are very easy to solve. However, as you progress, they become increasingly difficult. The difficulty progression, by the way, is perfect. There are two issues, though, that I have with the game. First. it froze on me in a couple of levels, requiring that I restart those levels. Second, the story told by the game is much too obscure. I finished the game well enough -- but even then couldn\'t comprehend the story. On another note, some reviewers here said they finished the game in about an hour. That\'s nonsense. There are 70 levels. They would have had to have completed each level in less than a minute or so on average. Due to the imposing complexity of many of the more challenging puzzles in the later levels, that\'s simply impossible. So, either those reviewers have a completely wacked-out sense of time or they\'re greatly exaggerating their puzzle-solving abilities.","Top notch game. Music is nice and relaxing. The graphics are simple but look great. There are quite a bit of mechanics in game that may look hard but the stage progression makes sure that you understand how they work before mixing it up. Overall it\'s a great concept and it\'s a nice relaxing game to play. On a puzzle I didn\'t understand, I put my phone down for a minute, grabbed it again and apparently I was holding my phone upside down and that got me to solve the puzzle. If they released another game like this I would definitely play it. 10/10 No Regrets.

I\'ve been loving it ever since it came out! It\'s been LOADS of fun, I\'ve been looking for a fun pinball game, and World Flipper is just that! I love the music, and all the characters, as well as the art style. The gameplay is lovely. Keep up the great work! Only problems is it lags and now it lags even more. It worked better on Apple, but on Android... it just loads so slowly. There is also some...buffering in one of the last cutscenes from world 8.","Overall so far, it\'s really good! Cute art style, and it is just super great, other than a somewhat huge issue. They seem to be having account issues today (Sept 19 2021) and it logged me out! I don\'t know what it is doing to others\' accounts currently, but if each account that isn\'t linked to Google or Facebook is just being lost, that is pretty bad. Just a fair warning to new players. Note: This hasn\'t happened since, so I think it is safe to say that it isn\'t an issue.","Super fun game! But my complaint (like some others) is that the background is incredibly glitchy. I can\'t play for long because it truly messes with my eyes. Like similar complaints, I\'m using a Google Pixel 6. I would love to adjust my rating after this issue is solved and I can really get into playing.","Very enjoyable, fun mechanics, and despite it being a gacha game I found it very easy to roll and get good units. I offer two improvements that can be made to the game: 1: Deadeye is annoying to play. I like that you have to aim the shot but sometimes if you land in the middle of the flippers you literally can\'t aim and are forced to miss. It feels frustrating to get a 10+ combo and be forced to miss 2. Immune frames should exist! You should be immune to damage when you use your special","An innovative twist that combines pinball w/ active combat. Both the pixel art & character illustrations are very charming. There\'s also a large cast of characters, allowing for a lot of fun viable playstyles, even w/ lower star units. Although the story can sometimes be simplistic/clich\xe9d, it still has an element of mystery around it which is greatly enhanced by the dynamics b/w characters. The only main issue would probably be how the rewards for events can require a ton of tedious grinding."],"appId":"com.kakaogames.wdfp","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kakaogames.wdfp&hl=en&gl=us"},"cc.jasfun.wizard":{"title":"Super Wizard","description":"About Game\\nSuper Wizard is a Roguelike action game in which more than 20 magic skills can be chosen.

It is called Magic Survival. It\'s the exact same concept, but done well. I\'d say get that one instead..","I never complain about ads, ever! But you guys took an original, decent game in its own right, put some much needed polish on it, and then made immersion into the game all but IMPOSSIBLE. I would challenge the devs to play the game now as it stands. Go to level 8 and onwards and you have to watch a 30 second ad every 2 minutes just to stand a chance of beating these guys! I believe in financially supporting the devs of games I enjoy, but 30 dollars?? That\'s highway robbery. This is too bad.","Gameplay is alright. After leveling up you lose control when returning to the game which is annoying. Character moves super stupid slow, also annoying. Real reason for 1 star is how awful the ads are, the quality is garbage. To remove ads you have to pay 30 dollars. So my first two gripes are about very intentional choices to get you killed so you can watch a terrible ad so you\'re tempted to overpay for this utterly average game.","Pretty fun. The ad bonuses are too good to ignore, though, and there are a lot of ad bonuses. I think it would be more tolerable on a per-run or rechargeable set of activations basis, but like this I\'m just not inclined to keep beating my head against a wall (since there\'s a lot of grind) /and/ through hordes of ads. Rather do something else with my time.","This can easily gets 5 stars. I love everything about the game and it\'s really easy to lose track of time with this. Only problem I have is after an ad or choosing a skill you\'re left standing there and have to pick up/place your finger back down which has gotten me killed a couple times already. I would recommend a \\"press to continue\\" feature after those? Would eliminate the chance of getting wrecked because you had to choose a skill.

Unlocked Medusa, mostly epic gear, and can\'t do a damn thing in this game. Main quest? Chp 4 is unbeatable. Doom Tower? Stage 4 is unbeatable. All the \\"extra events\\". Can\'t kill anything in any of them, so pointless. I like the game but playing levels 2 & 3 over and over and over again is really boring at this point. Oh yeah, and good luck getting coins to upgrade. WAY TOO EXPENSIVE EVERYTHING! 2/5","I changed this to a 1 star and now deleted my original because I am disgusted by this business tactic. Don\'t buy the pass to remove the ads because it only removes the ads for the \\"season\\" which is like 17 days long. So every season you need to pay to get rid of the ads. It\'s not a 1 time thing. Very trashy tactic. Developer responded to my review with misinformation. First of all, I\'m aware of which ads were removed for when the pass was purchased. Second, the seasons are not 45 days long.","Love the challenging and strategic style of game play but like all other games like this, if you want to get past level 10, get your credit card ready, maybe two. You can always get a second job. Game makers don\'t care about 90% of the players. Prices are based on the 10% of losers who are willing to pay a thousand dollars plus to be the #1. To the losers who do that, thanks for ruining for everyone else.","No matter how far away I am from enemy attacks they still do damage. So I\'m basically just playing to lose. Great job on this game guys. And way to rip off all the enemy attacks from other games. Uninstalled and I wish I could get my \\"ad removing\\" money back. Spoiler alert, it\'ll still give you ads.","Enjoyable game for its genre. Has good graphics, decent upgrades. BUGGY. After 90 seconds, game lags to 2 frames per minute, then locks up solid. Good news is the game autosaves correctly and closes easily. But you will have to restart the game every 90 seconds on average."],"appId":"co.imba.archero","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.imba.archero&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.gamigo.ext.town":{"title":"Fantasy Town: Farm & Friends","description":"Build your vibrant town replete with talented citizens, plant a farm full of prospering crops, or produce valuable goods like milk and eggs on an animal farm!

Drop by to experience sparkling new and improved gameplay in the latest version of Fantasy Town. The grass is always greener in Fantasy Town, so drop by soon!","comments":["Looove the game. Sooo much to do and unlock. This is a game you can play nonstop. NOT pay to win. Plenty of opportunity to earn what you need. Just wanted to let support/tech team know that there is a bug. When helping friends with trolls, you can click the three times initially, but the timed attack is not working. Other guildmates have had the same issue. Also, it would be a nice feature if you could flip the screen around when you like, instead of just at the start of the game. STILL 5 STARS!","Great visuals, cute and casual game. There are only two issues I have: one is the troll error (which sounds like the devs are working on), and the other is that there is no in game FAQ in the event that you need guidance. For example, I have leveled up to a point where I can access the \\"Premium apple trees\\", but I can\'t find them in the store at all. I\'m not sure if I\'m missing something but an online FAQ would be great to have for things like that!","The visuals are simple but adorable, the tasks are simple and the story is interesting and funny. I just have one problem and that\'s with helping your friends. There\'s this mission where trolls would be invading the town, and the player is supposed to have a boss fight. I got the first part of the mission out of the way with no problems, but when I try to start the boss fight, nothing really happens. I don\'t know if this is because the trolls mission is new or a bug but I want to have it fixed.","First off the overall gameplay is ok but there\'s lots of improvements that are needed like buying Items the time needs to be much shorter like I would say every 20 minutes instead of over an 1 hr. The other major issue is certain products should be made a lot quicker currently they take too long to make. I would give this game 5 stars but the game needs to be better improved.","I really love this game! People who complain about the tutorial going on forever, obviously have little to no patience. You can easily skip tutorials and the info is pretty useful anyways. It\'s like township but less complex, and the storyline is really fun to follow! I got this game yesterday and I\'m already level 12.. so maybe make gaining xp a little harder as you level up?"],"appId":"com.gamigo.ext.town","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gamigo.ext.town&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.playdigious.sparklite":{"title":"Sparklite","description":"Try Sparklite for free until the first Titan! \\n\\nSparklite is an Action-Adventure roguelite set in a whimsical and ever-changing land.\\n\\nGear up for Adventure and battle foes in top-down action using an arsenal of gadgets, guns, and gear.

My only complaints are that the controls can be poor (especially for the blimp bomb), the procedural generation is not varied enough to keep the maps interesting, and the game itself is quite grindy for resources to help push into deeper maps. That combined makes me play the game for a bit, then get bored, and months later okay it a bit more for a little while. Near-miss to potentially genius game.","Not a well designed game. Prices for upgrades are extremely high. It\'s more efficient to run straight to the casino and then reset than wandering the same ten map tiles fighting the same three enemy types. Basic enemies take off nearly half your life in one hit, even with upgrades. Many required tools aren\'t permanent upgrades but random drops. Hope you get a lamp this run if you want to see in the caves. And the lamp has three charges, so your walk into the cave is going to be a one-way trip.","Thank you so much for fixing the dualshock controller support! Now I can enjoy the game! I\'ve loved it from day 1, but the mobile controls were just making things way too difficult. I figured I\'d better check and see if it was fixed before I decided to re-purchase it on Switch, and wouldn\'t ya know! It\'s a very fun roguelike style game. Neat buffs you can find, and you only have so much room for them at one time, so choose wisley! I highly recommend this for retro RPG fans!","Top notch mobile RPG. Excellent controls that are simple and responsive, mechanics to match and from what I\'ve grasped of the story so far its all around one of the best mobile RPGs I\'ve played (And I\'ve played close to all of them, or at least far more than most \ud83d\ude02). I\'d easily rate this 6/5, definitely worth the 6.99. Or just have fun with the free trial, ( Don\'t kill the boss)","Absolutely fantastic game! Good leveling, good art, Great difficulty spike near the end. The only reason why I\'m giving it a two star is because I finally collected all of the notes and once I did the final song doesn\'t play! Was it a big MP3 file that got optimized out accidentally? I\'m on a pixel 6 pro. Anyway, I\'ll update my review if this is fixed."],"appId":"com.playdigious.sparklite","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.playdigious.sparklite&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.redspell.nanotanks":{"title":"Tanks vs Bugs","description":"Where archers fail, tanks rush in and prevail!\\nAs our general would always say: \u2018A tank-sized bug can only be handled by a TANK!\u2019 And this planet has them aplenty, right for everybody to have fun with!\\n\\nThe game features:\\n* Simple and intuitive controls;\\n* Various tanks, each has its unique combat style and strategy;\\n* Diverse enemy fauna demanding individual approach and tactics to defeat;\\n* Great many efficient combinations of combat skills to take advantage of in battles.\\n\\nGet into your tank and go decimate the bugs side by side with us!","descriptionHTML":"Where archers fail, tanks rush in and prevail!<br>As our general would always say: \u2018A tank-sized bug can only be handled by a TANK!\u2019 And this planet has them aplenty, right for everybody to have fun with!<br><br>The game features:<br>* Simple and intuitive controls;<br>* Various tanks, each has its unique combat style and strategy;<br>* Diverse enemy fauna demanding individual approach and tactics to defeat;<br>* Great many efficient combinations of combat skills to take advantage of in battles.<br><br>Get into your tank and go decimate the bugs side by side with us!","summary":"Where archers fail, tanks rush in and prevail!","installs":"500,000+","minInstalls":500000,"maxInstalls":530479,"score":3.84,"scoreText":"3.8","ratings":5616,"reviews":129,"histogram":{"1":720,"2":388,"3":617,"4":1178,"5":2687},"price":0,"free":true,"currency":"USD","priceText":"Free","available":true,"offersIAP":true,"IAPRange":"$0.99 - $24.99 per item","androidVersion":"5.1","androidVersionText":"5.1","developer":"Games Extras","developerId":"4837947296438587941","developerEmail":"tanksbugs@mail.redspell.ru","developerWebsite":"http://redspell.games/support_mobile","developerAddress":"815 N.

Level 16 to be exact. The first boss is not beatable and all my tanks are fully upgraded, 4th star level on one and full gear while playing the other modes. Every game in this genre falls into the same category.. If the developers would make it so you don\'t just endlessly fail on one level, maybe I would spend more money. The VIP level details are also locked behind the first purchase. It goes from $0.99 to $5.99. Wish I knew that BEFORE.","Unplayable game. Freezes on level 4 every time you collect the first mech piece. Game acts like it\'s playing, but tank is unmovable, cannot progress to next level. The joystick still looks like it\'s moving but the tank doesn\'t move. I liked the idea of this, it\'s to bad it\'s not playable.","This game looked pretty good for the first hour. Now it crashes constantly, mid run, and of course, you don\'t get credit for the crash, nor do you get the energy OR the prizes for completion. This kills games fast, and this one seems no different. Avoid, unless you enjoy frustration.","Alright gameplay. Daily rewards stop at day 16. Adverts don\'t work 90% the time. No possible way to get certain tanks without paying. An option to bin cards and receive a new one would be nice. Same for a vendor who sells parts for coins or other surplus parts.","I took my 5star back.

Games are design to be fun and progress but to force loot boxes to power up is pretty dumb.","Suprisingly good take on the roguelike genre! Instead of being that portrait mode game, that there\'s thousands of nearly identical clones of, this game does the autofire system, with weapons/armor upgrade at the end of each stage, same as others, but does it in landscape mode, unique, innovative graphics, great home base layout, intuitive u.i. The whole game takes a popular genre, turns it on its ear, and totally nails it in the process! GREAT game. Very pleasantly surprised!","So far so good fast paced futuristic RPG style rouge like,thats easy to learn and hard to master.. I will be editing this review after I get deeper into the story (first impression) (Update) Do yourself a favor and play this game\xa1! It is still a work in progress but it Looks and Plays Great, excluding the small fact that the underground rental shop does not work yet, But just take it as a challenge and dive right into the game for a hardcore cyberpunk roguelike experience you won\'t soon forget.","I\'ve tried a lot of games that draw inspiration from Archero, but they all lack originality. This completely reimagines that game and makes it much better. I would definitely recommend this to a friend. There\'s a few things, such as about 1% of the time, when you clear a floor, one bullet wont get destroyed. We need a menu to see what upgrades we\'ve gotten during a run. Standing Shoot is the worst upgrade in the game(is just like damage upgrade except it doesnt work when you\'re moving)","Very fun and challenging. I\'ve played a few \'auto shooters\' because but this one is different in all the good ways. Its challenging but fair it seems. Only thing I am having problem with is trying to figure out where and how you get the memories. Is there like some kind of challenge you have to do? Like take no damage during a boss run? Some clarification on how to get the missing memories would be nice."],"appId":"com.lnrgame.roguelike","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lnrgame.roguelike&hl=en&gl=us"},"ca.roofdog.pm3":{"title":"Pocket Mine 3","description":"Get on a mining adventure in this sequel to the sequel of the addictive hit game!

I like being able to collect different things and upgrade, but to really get decent stuff, you may need to spend money for upgrades. It gets repetitive in terms of gameplay, and without real money, its slow to obtain gems and upgrades. I will state that it is a decent game, its free so can\'t complain.","Normally I don\'t rate games but this one is pretty amazing. The chain reactions make a huge difference in game play along with you don\'t find your self wanting to buy rubies for anything extra. Though once you start getting into the added maps or the daily you start running out of energy a lot faster because they require more then 1 a normal game eats up. But the ads don\'t pop up nearly as often on some other games which I truly enjoy. You only watch them when and if you want to.","Decent enough app, at least on the off chance that you can play it without insufferable lag. The gameplay of the game is, collect/ upgrade cards + collect/ upgrade equipment + timed levels where if you take too long your try was worthless, oh, and don\'t forget the near constant lag. It wouldn\'t be as bad if the whole game froze but no, instead the game keeps running and ignores any taps/ input. So, good job?","Really fun game, would be immeasurably improved by actually being able to play it for more than about 10 minutes at a time. Even with the first cap upgrade the energy system is just too stingy. Something like a zero-cost, zero-loot mine that grants energy for reaching the idol could go a long way to improving the issue, without hopelessly unbalancing everything? Right now it\'s mostly a game about waiting.","I actually like the first pocket mine compared to this one. the first pocket mine gave you challenges to complete and you were able to go deeper without limit a d there were no monster. this one has too much going on. there aren\'t any challenges. too many different levels that end too fast. and the only thing you really customize is your gear. it gets repetitive and boring. the graphics are nice but that\'s about it"],"appId":"ca.roofdog.pm3","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ca.roofdog.pm3&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.grand.survival.ocean.adventure":{"title":"Grand Survival - Raft Games","description":" Grand Survival  is a  marvelous survival game   with unforgettable experience! \\n\\nBrave an ocean full of mysteries and danger with nothing but your wits and your raft.

Need to give away the mystery of the lab!","comments":["Pretty fun game. Typical raft survival recipe. Not very many things to craft. Clothing is really annoying to craft and doesn\'t last long for the cost. The reason I gave this game 2 stars is bc your character will ignore resources that you can be standing directly on top of bc the game prioritizes nearby enemies. It just will not let you interact with them at all, and it\'s maddening. Not interested in playing this game as long as this is an issue.","I really like this game compared to other survival games. Good graphics that are somewhat adjustable to save battery/memory. I like the cartoon-like graphics. It does need a little polishing. For instance, in your backpack when you have stuff on the furthest left slots the pop-up text is off-screen and unreadable. Controls get a little whacky when between zombies/crabs/whatever and resources. It\'ll target the enemy over resources and you can\'t get the resource until you kill the enemy.","All crafted items don\'t last long enough. Its a chore carrying 3 axes and 3 weapons to rubber island. Clothing or armor isn\'t strong enough. Glitches at the downed plane zombies are already dead. Go back to raft to depot, come back and they are all back roaming. Upgrades are too expensive when you can only get the gears at the hotel. Need better daily prizes for consecutive login. Gears maybe?? 20 to upgrade loom?! Movement is wonky. Good graphics though. It\'s worth trying out.","Update to my first post, don\'t know why it won\'t let me edit it. Upgrade my rating to 4 star from 2 star since they fix glitch with jellyfish. Again very good game with nice graphics. The only reason it\'s not 5 star is because I think the game needs just a few tweaks like other players suggested. Mainly for me it\'s the quick weapons and armor degradation, and the low energy. Wish they made your energy increase along with your leveling up. Anyway if you like survival games try this one.","This is a great game. There are a few bugs, for example, putting items in storage is really buggy. I have to open the storage multiple times, because it won\'t allow me to put items in. Also in the backpack I try to combine sets of like 2 and 3 peices of wood and it doesn\'t work. But other than a few bugs, it\'s a really good game. Good graphics. Smooth performance."],"appId":"com.grand.survival.ocean.adventure","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.grand.survival.ocean.adventure&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.swordman.reforged":{"title":"Swordman: Reforged","description":"Ready for more adventures with Sword Man?

However, there are many bugs within the game such as some ads that are watched to respawn not working after being watched. There isn\'t even a use for tickets inside the game (that I know of, correct me if I\'m wrong) and I feel that some levels are impossible for players who didn\'t grind.","To be clear I love this game. I know I gave it 2 stars but that is honestly because the game is not complete yet. I played the beta version of this and while this is much better than that one in many ways; it\'s still not finished. There\'s a lot the devs have to do. The movement/ attack controls are buggy. The loot drop system needs to be overhauled as I need to literally play one level 20+ times before a specific item will drop. This includes bosses. The cost of extraction is a bit too high too.","Great game. There are item drop frequency issues, stability problems, and minor control bugs, but I give it 5 stars because I know the game is a work in progress and updates are frequent. I am confident these things will be fixed. I played the Beta version, and it seems weapons can be upgraded much faster in this version....a very good change. Making most of the ads optional where the player is rewarded for doing so is great, too.","Excellent game. I cant tell if this is a sequel to the original or if it\'s a remake or what... but I have both versions installed & find them both to be great. Only issue I have is that I\'d like the controls to respond better. Very often it takes a couple button presses to start moving or to jump. As a platformer this seems like something that should be improved upon. But other then that, Very well done! Hey cool... I\'m from CT too. Keep up the good work fellow statesmen/women Lol :)","Played the first swordman in early development. There is no improvement. Not graphical, not performance, not feel for controls, not simplicity. I played through as many levels as I could handle but it\'s pretty much the same as the first game. I didn\'t enjoy the hand-holdy annoying tutorial that just makes you do things against your will without explaining them well (don\'t remember this from the first but they might\'ve implemented it later on).

Do you enjoy supply chain woes? Then this game is for you. Simple enough to start, but quite challenging pretty quickly. You think you\'re doing fine, then you run out of resources and it takes the next two hours to finish the last quarter of the mission. The story isn\'t great, and it gets grindy, but it\'s also a decent time suck.","This game is exceptionally difficult to control. Zooming in and out is almost impossible, even though it is a GAME CRITICAL NECESSITY. Even using my stylus for extra accuracy, the game will still select conveyor belts beside the thing you\'re trying to select AND THEN REFUSES TO DESELECT unless you move away and specifically select a grassy tile to force it to let go. Online help is pointless since the only results you are given concern REFRACTORY. Good game ruined by poor control.","still in the beginning stages but so far this is a pretty well designed crafting/survival game. the interface is extremely well designed and fluid and I\'m not fighting the controls in the slightest like I have in the past. even the design of the actual structures relieve the stress of building yourself into corners and making you redesign the most basic setups which of course makes it proportionately harder later on. it\'s reminiscent of factorio in its top down design but not stressful.","A good demo for a promising game, free version needs more content though. It wasn\'t long enough for me to determine if I would actually enjoy playing the full game. I\'ve played games like this one before where conveyor logistics were a major part of the game mechanics, and this one appears to address some of the issues that made those games tedious in the end, but once again, the demo doesn\'t let you explore the game enough for me to be sure.","I really enjoy this game, however I lost about 30 minutes of chapter 1, because the game doesn\'t have a back button or save button when you\'re actually playing in a mission, which I assumed meant it auto-saved. It doesn\'t. I just closed the game out not realizing this. But, you have to press the back button on your phone itself, then a menu will open to save the game.

Leave a review :)","comments":["Great game, poor customer service. Not sure why players are giving up by level 100, some of the options they want aren\'t available til 120- 200. So it\'s not the garbage they say, highly recommended game \ud83e\udd14. Side quests, events, \\"Hell Mode\\", castle gets bigger accommodating more heroes and towers. If you keep \\"grinding \\" which is the point of tins of games, it gets better. Don\'t listen to one person\'s opinion, and try it for yourself.","I\'ve grown weary of TD games that start out ok, then suddenly turn stupidly impossible at a certain level. So, this game caught my eye. User reviews made it clear that, while repetitive, you could advance and grow if you\'re willing to grind and watch some advertising. On this front, yes -- Wild Castle indeed is a game you can keep playing and playing, and I\'d like to thank the developers for this. If you\'re looking for a frustration-free TD game, go ahead and install it. But what needs to happen now is for the game to evolve so that there\'s more to do. In the game right now, with all the loot you earn from the perpetual grinding, you can upgrade your heroes, upgrade your turrets, and/or invest in various perks so that you can... uh you guessed it \u2026 keep grinding. The game is in desperate need for more ways to benefit from the work you put into it. How about more ways to design and develop your town, how about some adventures and campaigns, how about some events where you choose certain heroes to got toe-to-toe with certain villains, how about puzzles that we can solve for special rewards, how about the ability to occupy new castles and expand one\'s kingdom. Just anything to break the monotony. The opportunity is there, but right now, the game is just a repetitive dead-end, good for about a week or two of engagement.","It\'s so simple, I can\'t call it tower defense, but it\'s still very enjoyable. Waves of monsters roll towards your castle, and your defenders shoot them down. Upgrade to use more heroes, towers and archers, and enhance the abilities of the defenders and the castle itself. It\'s an endless loop, but it has stayed fun past level 300, so the devs did something right. Ads are optional, never thrust in your face. Recommended.","It\'s simple and repetitive. Can be decent while waiting at a doctor\'s office or something like that. Although there gets to a point where it\'s hard to improve and you feel stuck. Any improvement after a certain point comes in such small increments that tougher levels need way too much grinding. Also had to turn the music off early on. Just one song on loop.","The gameplay boils down to a never ending treadmill run that keeps going faster, but you earn points by running that you can use to increase your speed. Nothing really changes, and you don\'t go anywhere, you\'re just running in place. You have the option to watch ads and/or spend money if you want to put in less effort. You also can pay extra to have the computer run for you. Does paying a game to watch it play itself seem like an absurd thing to do to anyone else?"],"appId":"com.wildsky.wildcastle","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wildsky.wildcastle&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.com.tann.dice":{"title":"Slice & Dice","description":"Free demo, no ads, single IAP to unlock the full game.\\n\\nTake control of 5 heroes, each with their own dice.

I was impressed with the demo playthrough, and after buying the full version, I\'m even more impressed. Mechanically the game is simple but still requires good decision making, and the difficulty feels just right. As you progress you\'ll unlock more ways to deepen the experience. One of the better rougelites on Android.","This is one of the top games I\'ve ever played on mobile. The amount of variation and replay value is insane. Between characters, items, spells, leveling (you promote to new classes), modes, and difficulty, you get an incredible difference each game. I truly wish this game was still being worked on, but it\'s still 5 stars for me and will be playing this for years to come.","I love this game. It\'s exactly what I want in a turn based roguelike. One suggestion, allow players to skip the first 20 levels of curse mode by picking a bunch of curses and a boon. I can consistently get thru the first 20 levels, but it takes so long. I want to skip straight to the challenging bit.","Absolutely love this game. Have spent 30+ hours playing. One of the best mobile games out there. It has a steep learning curve if you\'re like me and too stubborn to read the rules at first, but once you get the swing of it it\'s very addictive and fun!

A few month later, after a long break: still a great games. Pros: The game excellently provides exciting fantasy adventure with lots of cool and funny moments, without taking away from realist tragedy befalling each world. Character progress is quite simple with time. Energy is not much of problem. Lots of story/sub-story. Your choice matter in the story. Cons: Is a gacha, be lucky. precise movement is a pain! The story difficulty spike","Overall I love it, but do have a few issues. The skill gap between player vs enemies gets to be too much to handle. Haven\'t been able to progress past the 2nd stage of World 11 part 2 because of this. There\'s also something wrong with the agora minigame in the Afterworld Inc. side story. I\'m certain I\'m selecting the correct evidence, but Charon catches me and I always lose anyway. Guess I\'m giving up on this part until the issue is addressed. Really do love this game, though.","Extremely fun game with many exciting and interesing things to do, if your stuck there are many ways to get over that, if you want better items, you can save up to trade things, if you don\'t have enough of something like gold or EXP theres something for that too! This game offers many rewards and possibilities, so you should definitely check it out!","So far, not bad... if overly simplistic. Took out a lv30 enemy with a level 18 character. Bow is super powerful. Edit: fast forward a couple of years. I haven\'t played in maybe a year, but the one before, I probably dumped $3k in, and totally enjoyed the game. It gets INTENSELY challenging, and it feels crazy having a max/EX character and still get stomped in story mode. I\'d say the game is very much worth playing!","EDIT: the game has started to freeze my phone up causing my system ui to crash and stop working. It happens everytime now and I\'ll start lagging during the worst times causing me to close app or my system ui stops working and freezes my phone. I\'ve Uninstalled game and even deleted a few apps even though I have enough storage. I love this game. Such cute graphics and the story mode is very enjoyable and interesting. I am having a lot of fun with this game.

Until the recent anomoly which lets you play old events (which I think is great!). 12 events, and you have to play whichever you choose 3 times in the less-than week it gives you for the highest tier reward. I worked hard, bought energy once, and still only managed two. It\'s too much for the short time limit :(","Probably near the best casual adventure/farming game I\'ve played. First and foremost, the story and characters are actually interesting! Secondly, the developers are very hands on with constant new content. They keep the story line moving at a consistent pace and make sure you get special adventures popping up a few times a month. You always have a little down time to gather energy so you don\'t have to spend cash though a little here and there supports the game and content! :) 9/10","When I tell you that energy runs out super fast, I mean SUPER FAST!! You get to play, literally, 5-10 minutes before not being able to do ANYTHING for at least 30 minutes. Maybe I\'m missing a way to get more energy quicker. No ads that I experienced, no bugs or glitches up to where I am, which isn\'t far. You can spend cash and prices are typical of mobile games, but you could spend alot QUICK. I just can\'t forgive the loss of energy unbelievably fast. UNINSTALLED","Great game and story lines. Exceptional customer service! I have been playing this game every day for two years and never grow tired of it. I have never \\"HAD\\" to purchase anything for any reason to keep going. This game has the most beautiful and vibrant graphics and there seems to always be a new challenge or island to keep it interesting. The characters become like close friends after a while. I really hope this game never ends!","Really love this game, the storyline and animation are top. Yeah it takes a while to get enough energy to really get going but once past a certain level there are so many options to get energy that you can accumulate quite a bit if you strategize. It\'s fun to play, defo 10/10"],"appId":"com.vizorapps.atlantis","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vizorapps.atlantis&hl=en&gl=us"},"tdcgame.zombie.idle.defense":{"title":"Zombie Idle Defense","description":"Hunt zombies and be a city king.\\n\ud83d\udc4dDefend against the zombie army\\nAn exciting, incredibly dynamic and terribly atmospheric strategy game with RPG elements that give you hours of real pleasure, and allows you to enjoy thoughtful gameplay.

Constant leveling and plenty of gear to pick up. But then like most of these games, you hit that one level that drastically increases the difficulty, your enemies have exponentially more highpoint than the previous level, and the only way around it is to spend money. It\'s a shame, this could have been a spectacular game. Then something funny happened. The developers actually listened to feedback. They fixed the issue And improved the gameplay. BRAVO!","Buggy, with some design flaws. It\'s mostly just grinding, but I enjoyed it. It does taper off lamely where there\'s little to do in the late game, so I quit. There is one character that specializes in weapons that don\'t seem to be offered except as $5 cash purchase, but generally everything else seems to be accessible. It is designed to get you to watch tons of ads by rewarding you for each one, but that seems fair.","I love this game! It\'s very addicting and I only have 2 stages left, all characters at S level and many guns almost at epic level. I enjoy seeing the progress and also playing idle mode gives you so much more rewards. I\'d definitely like to see more maps and different types of events. Currently I\'m having an issue. I was playing on one phone and it died on me. Just got a new phone today and my progress is lost as well as all the app purchases I made. Please help me to restore my account.","Not a bad game...but not what it says on the label (-2 stars). You have to work through 30 levels before you can get to any sort of \\"idle\\" growth, and most progress still has to be made with actively playing the game (-2 stars). That being said, the game is pretty entertaining, if heavy on the \'pay-to-win\' side. The controls and gameplay are fairly simple, the weapon upgrades are reminiscent of a merge game, and there\'s still enough free stuff to not make you feel like an ad slave. (+1 star)","I would give it 5 stars if there were more levels. I believe that if I had been patient enough to keep replaying levels, I could have saved more real money. Even at the pace I played, it didn\'t take much to reach the last level in 10 days. Once you beat Las Vegas and London, each day you get a Hero chest to augment what you have. As I said, patience to repeat levels can really save you real money. It is a fun game that is similar to a Tower Defense game without the placement strategies."],"appId":"tdcgame.zombie.idle.defense","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tdcgame.zombie.idle.defense&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.xtt.iasurv2":{"title":"Idle Arks: Build at Sea","description":"\ud83c\udf0aOnce, a sudden flood submerged every town.

You can\'t click away from her. There\'s no option to remove ads, and the \\"watch ad\\" crates are more prevalent than actual resources. Not worth the time.","I downloaded this app a few years ago and really enjoyed it, I changed phones and forgot about it until yesterday. I had been playing for a few hours and had built 6 rafts, I go to start the 7th raft and the app completely glitched. It asked me to submerge even though there was nothing built. It then froze. I restarted it a few times and the survivors where floating around. It would freeze on the welcome back screen. I uninstalled and reinstalled, lost all my progress.","Its alright as a game if you are trying to get rewards from another game, but if you aren\'t there isn\'t much of a point.

There are also a few typos but its still alright.","The game itself isn\'t bad honestly. My main issue is the \\"achievements\\". Once you do complete any of them, you have to watch an ad to claim your reward. It feels more like rewards for ads, as opposed to rewards for actually getting the achievement.

Ads are not too invasive unless you want to get something extra. Even gems can be obtained without paying money: you just have to be a bit patient. Kudos to developers! One issue is that once you advance to the next region, you can not get trains for the previous one except if you spend a lot gems. Those are very expensive (in terms of time or real money) and with each purchase you only get a small chance to get the trains that you miss, which makes it even more expensive.","Train WRECK Station still. Game crashes frequently. Doesn\'t matter what I\'m doing or not doing, game crashes frequently. Doesn\'t matter if this is the only thing I\'m running on my phone or switching between this and other apps, game crashes frequently. Game crashes in all phases of game play. It\'s a train wreck. Typical developer, won\'t try to solve their bugs, just asks to be contacted via a support email, chat, etc. \\"Please tell us what the problem is.\\" The problem is described above.","The game has been fun. Sometimes it can feel a bit repetitive but all games can get that way. One BIG issue is with the balance of grey locomotives and parts awarded. You almost always get grey parts and it makes new regions difficult when you can\'t upgrade other colored engines due to a lack of parts. Makes earning keys a waste of time due to only grey engines & you sell for grey parts. Balance needs revised. I\'ve spent nothing on the game (level 207) & there are ways to earn lots of free gems.","It\'s a good game and I do enjoy it but I wish it was closer to the original train station. collecting hundreds of different types of wagons was my favorite hobby on it. although I do enjoy playing the special events more on this one. like the American railway project where you could earn several locamotives that I liked the look of. And I apologize for my original review being disrespectful, I like the game and I didn\'t realize till now that you can upgrade the amount of trains you can run.","If you like trains, as I do, this game is awesome. It is a laid back game that is truly entertaining. You can collect resources without the fear of someone raiding your station before you upgrade something. The Regions are well designed, with exquisitely detailed background scenery. The physics of the trains navigating the tracks is extremely accurate. Sometimes it seems to take forever to complete Jobs, but that just gives me time to do something around the house. Highly recommend.

While it is mainly an Idle game, you are able to unlock a mode that allows it to be a fullly fledged game. The controls are responsive, the graphics look nice, the text narrator is funny, the puzzles are nice and complicated and there is a lot of content to keep you busy. That content isn\'t even just busy work as it helps your main goal progress further. My only issue is with the garden and the fact that you can\'t automatically restart when you wish too.","I loved this game, i played through most of it once and i decided to come back to finish the story. Now theres way more ads than before. Ads everytime it opens, ads while i placing survivors to tasks, ads telling me to go watch other ads to get rewards. I get mobile games have ads but i dont need them swarming the game while im reading important story.","I love the concept of the game along with the good story. The biggest issue with it is that after installing and playing it the game freezes on the storyline and won\'t let me click the button to continue and when i try to re-enter the game it never loads me in and forcing me to uninstall because it is unplayable. Same thing happens for tinker 2 so I don\'t know what the problem is.","I\'ve played before, tried again to see if it changed, it didn\'t. Ads, and so on, yeah it\'s free but, the progress is extremely slow, you\'re also lucky if your survivors don\'t die before you find more. I love the concept, the story is pretty neat. The options and chances make it pretty interesting, but if you want true success you need to pay. It\'s a phone app. Either charge for the game or make it 100% free. Stop this in app purchase bull****... uninstall... second time....","I like the game while it\'s actually working, but it lags pretty badly after a bit... a short bit. Like 10 mins. I have a relatively newer phone, too, so I doubt it\'s something to do with my end. The lag makes it difficult to drag cards around, view the map and the flower garden is... buggier than a bug bomb could fix! I\'ve missed out on quite a few of those gemdactyl things, too. Without the lag, this is a rather nice game. I just wish I didn\'t need friends to enjoy certain parts of it. :/"],"appId":"com.kongregate.mobile.tinkerisland.google","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kongregate.mobile.tinkerisland.google&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.FunFlavorGames.HeroPark":{"title":"Hero Park","description":"Welcome to Hero Park,\\n\\nthe place where magical unicorns attract heroes into your town for their own little adventure. This is the story of you, your unicorn and a treasury full of gold!\\n\\nFive years after the Great War, the old war hero and his faithful unicorn return to their home town and find that not a stone is left standing on another. The town is empty and the once glorious dungeons are now abandoned. The decision is clear: the town must be rebuilt, new monsters bred and the dungeons populated again.\\n\\nCreate the perfect illusion of an adventure town with busy blacksmiths, bustling taverns, and glorious dungeons with monsters bred by you. Meet fascinating characters who want to join you and use their skills to lure the hero\'s gold out of their purses. Make Hero Park what it used to be: the most magnificent town in the kingdom!\\n\\nFeatures:\\n\u2605 More than 100 fabulous characters: heroes, shop keepers, vampires, unicorns and more\\n\u2605 Design your town according to your wishes and automate your production\\n\u2605 Breed monsters for your dungeons and shape them according to your needs\\n\u2605 Immerse yourself in the magical world of elves, humans and dwarves\\n\u2605 Experience the exciting story of an old war hero and his unicorn\\n\u2605 Solve exciting quests and loot valuable treasures...\\n\u2605 ... and stop your unicorn from eating everything!\\n\\n\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nFrequently asked questions (FAQ)\\n\\n\\n1. How can I have the heroes trained?\\n\\nThere are several ways to increase the chance of training. It is especially helpful if the hero has bought an experience potion (yellow potion) beforehand. The chance of training is also increased if the hero can defeat a high level monster or defeats several monsters.\\n\\n\\n2. How can I have a hero blessed?\\n\\nA hero wants to be blessed after having his suffering (e.g. diseases caused by undead monsters) treated in the temple. The different blessings are only valid for certain races. So in the beginning only one blessing is available for elves and it can be helpful to attract as many elves as possible to the village.\\n\\n\\n3. How can I reduce the charging time of the unicorn energy?\\n\\nThe recharge time can be reduced by up to 10 minutes. This is done by ranking daily tasks (from level 10, up to 4 minutes), Santa\'s brother (from level 11, 2 minutes) and using the unicorn trainer (from level 20, up to 4 minutes). With Santa\'s brother there is also the possibility to produce unicorn food, which can be used instead of energy.\\n\\n\\n4. How can I delete or reposition a building?\\n\\nSelect a building and open the building menu with the button in the upper left corner. Select \\"Store building\\". If you now want to move this building somewhere else, click on an empty field and select the building from your storage. \\n\\n\\n5. Can I find improvements in treasure chests for employees who cannot be found in treasure chests?\\n\\nAs soon as an employee is on your team, you can find improvements in treasure chests with the same probability.\\n\\n\\n6. I can\'t get any further with the task \\"In your village you need 10 cats\\" and need a tip?\\n\\nThis task can only be solved at level 28.

This is the story of you, your unicorn and a treasury full of gold!<br><br>Five years after the Great War, the old war hero and his faithful unicorn return to their home town and find that not a stone is left standing on another. The town is empty and the once glorious dungeons are now abandoned. The decision is clear: the town must be rebuilt, new monsters bred and the dungeons populated again.<br><br>Create the perfect illusion of an adventure town with busy blacksmiths, bustling taverns, and glorious dungeons with monsters bred by you. Meet fascinating characters who want to join you and use their skills to lure the hero&#39;s gold out of their purses. Make Hero Park what it used to be: the most magnificent town in the kingdom!<br><br>Features:<br>\u2605 More than 100 fabulous characters: heroes, shop keepers, vampires, unicorns and more<br>\u2605 Design your town according to your wishes and automate your production<br>\u2605 Breed monsters for your dungeons and shape them according to your needs<br>\u2605 Immerse yourself in the magical world of elves, humans and dwarves<br>\u2605 Experience the exciting story of an old war hero and his unicorn<br>\u2605 Solve exciting quests and loot valuable treasures...<br>\u2605 ... and stop your unicorn from eating everything!<br><br><br><br>-----------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Frequently asked questions (FAQ)<br><br><br>1. How can I have the heroes trained?<br><br>There are several ways to increase the chance of training. It is especially helpful if the hero has bought an experience potion (yellow potion) beforehand. The chance of training is also increased if the hero can defeat a high level monster or defeats several monsters.<br><br><br>2. How can I have a hero blessed?<br><br>A hero wants to be blessed after having his suffering (e.g. diseases caused by undead monsters) treated in the temple. The different blessings are only valid for certain races. So in the beginning only one blessing is available for elves and it can be helpful to attract as many elves as possible to the village.<br><br><br>3. How can I reduce the charging time of the unicorn energy?<br><br>The recharge time can be reduced by up to 10 minutes. This is done by ranking daily tasks (from level 10, up to 4 minutes), Santa&#39;s brother (from level 11, 2 minutes) and using the unicorn trainer (from level 20, up to 4 minutes). With Santa&#39;s brother there is also the possibility to produce unicorn food, which can be used instead of energy.<br><br><br>4. How can I delete or reposition a building?<br><br>Select a building and open the building menu with the button in the upper left corner. Select &quot;Store building&quot;. If you now want to move this building somewhere else, click on an empty field and select the building from your storage. <br><br><br>5. Can I find improvements in treasure chests for employees who cannot be found in treasure chests?<br><br>As soon as an employee is on your team, you can find improvements in treasure chests with the same probability.<br><br><br>6. I can&#39;t get any further with the task &quot;In your village you need 10 cats&quot; and need a tip?<br><br>This task can only be solved at level 28. Once you have cats in your village, remember that all cats need love.

It\'s more like an idle game than something to play actively. Early on, there are some interesting building portions. After that, the main gameplay is completing challenges, restocking resources, and hero improvement. That does not drive me to keep playing as the challenges are meh. There is no combat to directly influence and the \\"city building\\" part is pretty bare bones. If there was an incentive to keep playing, the energy system is pretty low payout.","The game starts out at a good pace with fun mechanics. Once you hit about midgame and the unicorn statue unlocking, everything becomes an exponentially longer wait with no way to scale \\"the business\\". You\'ll think \\"ah. This is just the plateau to cross and there is more features coming in leveling up the castle. Let me spend a few weeks building 1.5 million gold and the next unlock will be for 2 more additional heroes instead of just 1. \\" no chance at that. Slow goes the boat. Disappointing","This game appears to be quite simple, but as you level up, more and more features unlock. I think a number of other reviewers would have benefited from being able to see what unlocks with levels. The castle is a game changer as well. It would be nice for all the random tips to be listed somewhere, like a hero might buy a different staff than listed. That\'s a big deal for quests, but not obvious unless you\'re watching closely.","My only complaint so far is that I can\'t find, or there isn\'t, a button to instantly swap between buildings. Update (1/21/20): No other issues so far. Occasionally they\'ll have some really sweet deals if you take some time to understand the value of each piece of the game. Absolutely ZERO popup ads which is always wonderful. Very easy to play, and restricting enough to keep you from playing TOO much in a day since it\'s very easy to lose track of time playing it, lol. Great game, never deleting.","The game is decently fun with an interesting storyline, however, the lack of shop variety is kind of disheartening. Everything takes quite a fair amount of gold to level up as well. It feels grind-y. I do love the art style and the game itself does not pretend to be anything other than what it really is I would like to suggest adding Champions that require goods/monsters/treasures to be a specific level for them to visit. Give us some goals other than quests, please. It would be appreciated."],"appId":"com.FunFlavorGames.HeroPark","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.FunFlavorGames.HeroPark&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.tiedan.game.EdgeOfDoom":{"title":"Edge of Doom: Zombie Crisis","description":"Story background: After a terrible Resident Evil broke out, the world became a wasteland.

","comments":["There are way too many ads, I watch an ad then when I\'m opening a box 10 seconds later there\'s an ad. There\'s also noway to increase energy as far as I know. 50 is too low because some of the levels have a lot of 2 or 3 hit block things. The rest of the game is good, being able to customize the museum is a good Quality of Life addition.","So first let me turn off saying this is a fun idle game. I enjoy digging up the fossils and a sense of Mystery behind it because you never know what you find. It\'s not hard to understand how to play the game, the music is nice and the features such as poses and skins make for a nice touch. However, I have a hard time using the map, if you can. The only way I know how is by leveling up and because of this I recently ran into a glitch where I\'m leveling up faster than normal and skipping dig sites","Overall this is a good game I like digging for dinosaur fossils and putting them in a museum. And you can change the poses and add skins to the dinosaur skeletons (I mostly use the skins to hide the incomplete dinosaur skeletons). But I can\'t find the bones that I want. For instance, I can\'t find the archaeopteryx head and arm at 3 star quality. Please fix.","This is a very fun game. I enjoy getting all the dino bones..... However, my game started crashing randomly a week ago. No biggie as it\'s still a work in progress. Except now it can do anything without it crashing. Go to dig - crash, go to lab - crash, just open the game - crash. Will give a 5 star as soon as fixed.","I love the game, the digging, the graphics, all the little things you can do, etc. However a horrible bug that should\'ve been fixed long ago is the ads. You have the choice to watch them when you run out of moves and a lot of times it won\'t give you rewards after you watch them. It\'s extremely annoying. Would be 5 stars if not for this huge issue"],"appId":"com.tapps.games.dig.dinoquest2","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tapps.games.dig.dinoquest2&hl=en&gl=us"},"online.limitless.appleknight.free":{"title":"Apple Knight: Action Platformer","description":"Apple Knight is a modern action platformer with precise touch controls, fluid movement, and smooth animation.

The ads aren\'t intrusive, they give you one if they die after a long time In the game and everytime you complete a lvl. The problem is that the game doesn\'t save until AFTER the add. I complete a lvl and if I accidentally click an add and it takes me away from the game, I click back in and progress lost and if an add waits a full minute till the x shows and you go out and back in, redo the lvl :/","Fantastic platformer! There are several worlds, each with it\'s own environment and series of levels. Each world has it\'s own feel about it all while leading to a big boss at the end. You gain loot so you can buy new weapons, skins and some abilities to customize your hero. When you get to that point where your hero is unstoppable there is the ultra hard mode where one mistake will stop your run, so speed runners and cassual players can get their preferred experience. Excellent job team!","Great time killer, the controls are easy to use, great graphics and gameplay. I would rate it 5 stars if it weren\'t for the add glitch where the x button takes a long time to pop up and my progress would be lost, but other than that Great game, If you\'re bored this game is what I recommend playing.","This game is lots of fun with options for gamers of all levels. It\'s a platformer, so the controls really need to be very tight (i.e., precise), and the developers did a solid job with that. Plus, it has controller support(!), which takes it to another level for me because of the tactile experience of buttons. The game is free with ads, but the number of ads isn\'t too overwhelming, and you get quite a bit of rewards for watching, especially if you do so voluntarily. Overall, a great experience.","Game\'s got it all. Great sidescrolling platformer, controller compatible, HIGHLY recommended!! You don\'t have to watch ads, unless you choose to, and any in game purchase, even just .99\xa2 removes adds. As for in game purchases, most of them can be bought with either real money, or coins from the level, making relatively few items behind a pay wall. Ads, and micro-transactions are by choice only, and not necessary. So it\'s not only a GREAT platformer, but really considerate of players!

Used to play pretty regularly, and would even willingly watch an ad now and again, but now they don\'t give me a choice; there are ad pop-ups with no button to close except the one to watch the ad. It\'s unfortunate. Ever since DECA took over, the player experience has really suffered. Changes are made that clearly make watching ads the only really way to progress or play the game. Save yourself the heartache and move on.","So I like the game but it\'s now broken because I cannot progress at all. Every time I reopen the app to try and progress, the aeon gates is stuck and I cannot abandon the gate even though the timers at zero and my other gates just keep resetting to the last time I open the game. I\'m trying to force update the game and see if that fixes it. If not then I\'m just going to uninstall and not bother with it. Problem has been fixed with an update.","Great gameplay with steady sense of progression. Each of the heroes can be upgraded in multiple useful ways. The menus are clear and easy to use. There is NO paywall that prevents enjoyment once you reach a certain point, though there are cosmetics and boosters you can buy if you want to. The art style is humorous, colorful, and clear. The devs are also steadily improving and adding features to make it interesting for both new players and veterans. A fun clicker game with meaningful choices.","I love this game a lot, and have easily spent a few hours in the past week upgrading various characters and unlocking as much stuff as possible. I\'ve been able to upgrade every character to Epic so far except for Lia. For whatever reason, the game crashes every time I attempt to upgrade her, and as a result, she\'s still stuck at the Common level. I\'ve sent the error reports, as requested, but nothing has come of it. I just want to be able to use Lia, but she is too low-level now to be effective.","This game was great. I literally played it every day and have played it for so long. However they recently updated where if you lose on a boss you are automatically sent back levels. This means even when not playing and you lose you will go back. Very frustrating to get so far and then not be able to sit there and not play the boss to earn upgrades. unfortunately after being very dedicated and playing a lot. I\'m going to have to uninstall."],"appId":"com.beesquare.almostahero","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.beesquare.almostahero&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.RetrostyleGames.LastPirate.deadthieves":{"title":"Last Pirate: Survival Island Adventure","description":"Survival and Pirates in free pirate adventure simulator!\\n\\nYour survival started on the lost island.

This is 100% better than the other raft/survival game. The game has tons of content, better graphics, and it\'s not stingy with items. Controlling movement, targeting, and building UI can be tough..but thats common with all mobile/tablet apps. This is a 5-star game regardless of the platform. ---edit--My inventory just vanished. Please restore my items. I do not want to craft all my items again...and several stacks of other materials.","I don\'t like that it erases your entire inventory of items every time you die. Even of things you\'ve already built. It\'s pretty impossible to get a good thing going if you have to start from scratch every time (and be forced to go reclaim your \\"lost\\" items wherever you died, starting from the origin point on the island to boot!) Not a great game for me. Would be otherwise.","It\'s a fun game. A question for the developers: am I supposed to be able to upgrade my boat house past level 3? The paper by the entrance lights up but there are no options like before. I\'m not sure if it\'s a glitch or that\'s all I can do Edit: there hasn\'t been any response from the developer. This game is full of loads of glitches. After grinding forever to get into the dungeon, the results were super underwhelming, and there was really nothing left to do. There\'s also a church for no reason.","Love the game in general. However one thing that would help out some is more of a tutorial in game. Or shorts scripts for items. There isn\'t much to find on internet about it. For instance what is the green bottle with red dot that appeares on the screen randomly. One other thing that may hold interest longer is to possibly have more to explore. Maybe different areas after different levels. A way of panning out would be good too, some areas are just to close up, especially in bushy areas.","Overall happy, a few minor things. When I upgraded from camp 2 to 3 the second floor changed height. So the chests I put up there went through the floor and now hang on the ceiling. Not an issue as I can still access but disappointing, the loom also went partially through the floor. It seems like there should be a level 4 as the stats weren\'t maxing and the paper still glows blue but I can\'t interact with it anymore."],"appId":"com.RetrostyleGames.LastPirate.deadthieves","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.RetrostyleGames.LastPirate.deadthieves&hl=en&gl=us"},"jp.oridio.museum":{"title":"TAP!

Ads aren\'t intrusive and they give helpful boosts, game play isn\'t limited by an energy meter, and progression isn\'t very slow either.

Ads are uncommon and short. Money might be tight in the beginning but you\'ll soon be generating money faster than you can spend it. Any of the items bought with gems are single use and are a minor benefit at most, in other words, totally unnecessary. Its cute and fun and basically the perfect mobile game. Has everything you might want in a mobile game without any of the problems that other apps suffer from!","It\'s a fun little clicker to pass time, and they\'re right, I do enjoy trying to guess which dinosaur it is on every dig, lol. I\'m playing the Play Pass version, so there are no microtransactions or ads, which makes the experience a lot more enjoyable (gem purchases are free, just time-locked). Only downside is some mechanics aren\'t very well-explained, you just have to kind of figure them out through trial and observation. Not sure the point of all the tools, upgraded pickaxe handles everything.","Great game, but its way too repetitive, you\'ll keep digging until you complete a skeleton, then rinse and repeat. The only fun part is trying to guess the dinosaur before you complete it. Other than that its just a really simple and easy game that will make you addicted for a few days and will be boring after which leads to uninstalling the game.","This is in a top ranking class amongst very few mobile games. I\'m a total sucker for dinosaur stuff and this is fantastic I adore the look of the pixelart dino fossils, the gameplay is enjoyable being a mix of digging and museum design, the placement of ads is outstanding compared to some of these billboard trash heaps in the playstore and the choice to watch for a reward is great!

Let us know what you think of Day R Survival by leaving your review.","comments":["So addicting. Almost no ads. Only the ads make flashing screens. Easy on the eyes. No sexual content. I love the lack of explaination, or excessive story line. Just wake up in the thick of survival. Free to play. As challenging as you make it! I got my boat stranded in the ocean right away. I have to wait till next spring (in game) to retrieve it. I MUST GET GREEN HOUSE. Homestead is where the heart is.","I still remember when this game was in it\'s early stages, and how far it\'s come! A story line I can get behind and various challenges and companions you can meet in your journey keeps the game fresh and exciting! With this new combat system they have, has also added a bit of strategy in how you approach every battle! With the addition of villages you can now get materials and items you may have had trouble getting in the past! Def a must download if you love survival games,especially post apoc!","*Meanwhile in Russia* But seriously this is way better than other mobile survival games I\'ve played, not sure what exactly makes it better but it\'s definitely worth your time. It manages to outdo games that need 10x the storage space AND an internet connection. One thing that might improve this game is a chance to loot backpacks and things, I have a tendency to keep practically everything I find. Then again, I do that alot.","Good detailed game. Hard to play if in One Life mode. Update to post is it\'s a great game and better than any other. I have learned how to upgrade and use recipes for weapons, outfits, and to make iron and steel. Using easy premium mode from two years old account. Started playing two months ago and I am on level 89. I have been on life saving mode about ten times and I don\'t lose anything but that one level. Better game play and user interface on my android tablet is better than on my phone.","Edit: when the level system was added some time ago, I had just recently earned blacksmithing and had poured resources into it, but my progress was rolled back so I couldn\'t craft anything anymore without doubling my current character level. That was a huge bummer, still kind of sore about it too. But that aside still a good game and improving regularly. Maybe make some other ways to farm exp than just fighting and daily missions. It\'s not consistent enough."],"appId":"com.gm_shaber.dayr","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gm_shaber.dayr&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.dawinstone.b2be":{"title":"Bad 2 Bad: Extinction","description":"\u25c6 Caution\\nYour data will be reset if you change your device or delete the game.

The minigun makes you stand still and you die quickly because of it. Equipped weapons and gear shouldn\'t take up backpack space, because they\'re not in the backpack, they\'re equipped. There\'s a few errors in spelling and grammar as well. It doesn\'t tell you there\'s a chance to lose guns when combining them either.","This game is good, but there are a few things that can improve. There should be a way to reduce the effect/duration of stun and poison; there should be an option to revive with 5~10 dias next to the watch ad option; and there should be a cancel reload button. I\'ve been looking for a loot shooter that wasn\'t a one-handed roguelite, and this one works well. I especially enjoy the attachment system. Overall a good game, albeit flawed. Still recommend picking this up. No forced ads, which is a win!","Amazing 2D shooter game with a hint of 3D gameplay. The depth in attachments as well as equipment and bonuses from them is very balanced. The number of guns is sufficient along with the characters you can assign to your team. The flare is a great part of the game, Waves are there to give you resistance but calling in all the waves at once can end the resistance faster and can stack damage so the more enemies in line of fire, the more collective damage you can do with the same ammo. No complaints","This is a great game, it really is. It has a logical and likeable story line, the characters are cool, the wilders are an interesting kind of undead enemy and the enemies are awesome, the amount of guns and weapons system to the game is great and logical, same with the fighting system and the world map, but I just have a few complaints. Could you add different reloads to different guns such as a magazine removal and attachment animation for magazine fed guns? the reloads are a bit dull.","First of all, very good game. The gameplay is really fun and there aren\'t very many mobile games out there like this. But there are a few problems. First of all, it crashes alot. Mostly when I bring up a GUI or start a mission. I also have a complaint about the gorilla character. I love apes and monkeys but the gorilla looks horrible. I only wish that the eyes were a bit smaller and the chin was more defined (The nose Also juts out for some reason like a cliff edge (Also more primates please)"],"appId":"com.dawinstone.b2be","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dawinstone.b2be&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.superplusgames.oos":{"title":"Oceans of Steel","description":"Jump on board!

Ads are everywhere. You can\'t open certain things in the hud without an ad, can\'t leave a location without an ad, can\'t look at your inventory without an ad, and the microtrans prices are absolutely insane, $14 for a virtual car? $9 for a blinged pew pew that eventually you will have to replace. Great game, bad marketing.","I went from level 67 all the way down to level 23. Lost all of my gear and progress. Have repeatedly reached out to support but no response. Please fix for a higher rating. Stop your ads from killing people!!! When I am in the middle of a mission I click on my backpack and an ad pops up when it\'s done game crashes and sends you back to town at 20hp. Even if you have 150hp it will send you back. Very frustrating. The game would be great if it didn\'t crash so much(like every other ad)","So far the game is enjoyable. Controls are pretty good. The real downside so far is the ads for bonuses as well as to sell to the merchant for reasonable prices. I don\'t mind ads when they are used to keep the game free. However, I purchased the $5 no ads pack and still continue to receive ads. I have email their support and will update after I receive a reaponse","It\'s fun to play (when you can!). Between the overwhelming adds,and if something happens when you\'re in the middle of a task, you start out with very little life and losing everything you worked for. Would love to just play a game that they are not trying to constantly get you to buy stuff! I\'ll probably end up deleting this game a second time! Hard to enjoy and have fun when you\'re concentrating then you have to watch and skip an add...every other move! Very frustrating to say the least!!!!!\ud83e\udd2c","It\'s a really fun game, surprisingly detailed for a polygon game. But there are way to many ads! It\'s so frustrating trying to do stuff in the game cause there\'s an add every thirty seconds, or you have to watch an ad just to talk to someone or go in your backpack. This would be a 5 star game if it wasn\'t for the overwhelming number of unnecessary ads"],"appId":"com.aldagames.zombieshooter","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aldagames.zombieshooter&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.dreamgate.steampunktower2.android":{"title":"Steampunk Tower 2: The One Tower Defense Strategy","description":"Steampunk Tower 2 is a unique tower defense game for free set in the alternative Steampunk universe. \\n\\nThere is a dragged-out world war with the enemy never seen before.

During battles: when you upgrade a tower there is no indication of which towers are the strongest. You have to select each individual tower to see the stats. I also wish you could select for certain towers to ignore units, such as wasp only attacking air at certain times. At base: when upgrading units there is no indication about what the parts are doing. It\'s too easy to recycle upgrades, should have to confirm. Interface is a bit cluttered.","Fun game play and excellent graphics. Translation to English is mediocre. I\'ve currently been stuck with a game breaking bug where I can\'t tap any icons and I\'m stuck at the base view. I can\'t open any other screens, can\'t open the map, any buildings, or anything at all except the wheel spin minigame. Restarting my phone didn\'t fix and now I\'m totally unable to do anything.","Interesting game with simple mechanics and a slow pace (best to play no more than 20 min/day). It takes a real hit in playability, though, because mobile was made to have a very small view of the battlefield so when you get to mid game enemies are regularly shooting at you from off screen and you have to guess where they\'re at with your super shots. Watching PC replay vids it\'s also obvious the shortened field of view has made the bonus levels needlessly difficult. Overall it hurts the gameplay.","The concept is great however the game needs balancing. The resources of gold and etherium are to easy to get, however parts to upgrade the guns are way to hard to find. In addition, you have to have a certain experiance level to upgrade your buildings to move forward. However I have completed all of the side missions (which give experiance), and one only pops up every 8-12 hours. At this rate it could take me weeks to get to the next level. I cant even buy my way out! This is a true game flaw!","The gameplay, defending your tower, is pretty good. Moving turrets to the middle to quickly reload in-between waves is fun. Just one problem though, when you don\'t have enough fuel for a mission, you\'re (mostly) stuck waiting half an hour or more just to play the main part of the game. Never mind the long construction times, never mind that you have to spend premium credits just to use your super weapons after the first free use, I could\'ve given the game four stars if it weren\'t for the fuel mechanic."],"appId":"com.dreamgate.steampunktower2.android","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dreamgate.steampunktower2.android&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.datavisionstudio.roguelike":{"title":"Heroics Epic Legend of Archero","description":"Collect legendary weapons, level up your hero, choose new skills, and rip through legions of monsters!\\n\\nRun, shoot, explore, and become stronger.

Each game costs 1 key and you only get 3 keys lol! Each upgrade is random, and the good upgrades you will get literally once every 10 games lol! Some of the maps they intentionally make impossible to win on. The levels scale up ridiculously fast from easy to impossible in only one level. It\'s a joke how impossible they make it so you have to pay. If they would have made it playable, I\'d have paid for it...","An extremely fun game, map design could use some work. As a lot of times the hardest enemy seems like the terrain. My main gripe though is you cannot see ailments applied to your player. You can see it when applied to the enemies, so why not your playable character? That is my main reason for 4 not 5 stars. Overall fun game and anyone should give it a try.","I play a lot of these games and this one just makes me say \\"ok, I see what you did there.\\" the characters speed is just slightly to slow that you get hit by things you probably should be able to avoid. the enemies bullet speed is just slightly to fast and you\'ll get hit. You can\'t always tell when the enemy bullets will hit a wall or go over. it\'s things that makes me think they did it on purpose so you die and speed money on power ups. Which I understand they are a business and want to make money. it feels scummy tho. it\'s hard to describe but in a lot of other games, when you get hit or die, you feel like it was a fair death. in this game, I just die and don\'t quite know why. That can all be forgiven because I like a challenging game and I don\'t mind spending money, my biggest complaint is the amount of ads there are. for an example. you can watch 6 ads to get the 6 main resources for upgrades. they don\'t give you enough during the missions. it feels like playing 3 missions gives you as much at 1 ad. then they have \\"epic\\" chest that you can watch 6 ads and unlock 1 chest. even if you get a good item, you\'ll have to watch more ads to get the gold to craft it. but you\'re in luck, you can buy a pass for no ads.. for a week or 2 weeks or 1 month. no options for a 1 time buy. The ads are also difficult to close out of. sometimes they play for 1 min and no x will appears for another 10 -15 seconds. if you click anywhere on the screen it will take you to the google page. when you go back to the game, the x still wont show up sometimes. A few times I was unable to exit the ads and had to close out my game and I didn\'t get credit for watching. You\'ll spend more time watching ads than playing the game.","Developers deleted my review, so I will elaborate... The game itself is fun! But that fun is limited, as the ads are aggressive, by sometimes locking you into them and you\'re unable to leave the ad, which means you have to close the game and lose progress. The no-ad purchases are greedy and TIME LIMITED. I\'d happily pay a one time small purchase for no ads, but that should not have a time limit to it.","I really like it, so far. A perchase for no ads is very very helpful give you lots of free stuff and it\'s not expensive. But if you want you can watch lots of ads instead to get the same items. Ive played just one day and it\'s my top three favorite game. I hope \ud83e\udd1e it stays that way. Update: I\'ve been playing two weeks now. I still really like this game. I have confirmed that it is far better to remove the adds and support the developers with inexpensive purchases, free is a lot of ads to watch"],"appId":"com.datavisionstudio.roguelike","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.datavisionstudio.roguelike&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.ctugames.km2":{"title":"The Wild Darkness","description":"Inside a forest on a mysterious world...\\nA sorcerer is casting a spell in the dark.\\nOnce the ritual was complete, a streak of light fell from the sky.\\n\\nThen you regain consciousness in the middle of a strange forest.\\nWhere...

It is rather fun, I must say, even with its difficulty. Much to explore, much to discover. I recommend getting some extra cash, though, to at least be able to have 1 Revival Ahnk, and better remains. If not, well, good luck; you\'ll be needing every drop of it once you begin, trust me Sweetling.","I really really enjoy this game. But I have an issue when I save a game and reload it later. There seems to be something missing when I come back. I have had multiple bottles of water missing from my inventory and I have had my fire pit gone and I don\'t have enough stone to rebuild one making it very difficult. These aren\'t the only two instances of this happening, although it\'s not every time. I hope the creator sees this and takes a look into why this happens.","The Wild Darkness, is a very challenging survival game for the strong minded who is willing to sacrifice it all in order to defeat the all the bosses. You must survive Diseases, The elements, against curses and magics, Random game play, unique monsters; fantastic game with a great art style and game play. Warning: for those willing to play if you die then you will most certainly lose all your progress. It\'s all part of the hard frustrating-painful fun to achieve the unachievable.","This game is an incredible rogue like survival game. The difficulty in the beginning had a definitive curve that lessened with each play through. The 4\u2606 review would have been 5, but I feel the devs are catering to those that whine too much. Food was very scarce prior to the update, which made several totems and strategy paramount to survival. After the update, I seem to find food in every container & blade of grass. I admit to wishing food was easier to acquire; however, it is TOO easy now.","I really loved this game at first, amazing concept, cute animation and fun gameplay but when you die, you lose your whole game-save. I was super disappointed and unhappy about this, it\'s hard to survive in this game and having to lose all your progress after dieing once is very angering. I wish at least you would lose all your inventory items, or maybe have to die 3 times to lose your progress instead of this. I would have given a 5 star review if you didn\'t lose your progress when you die."],"appId":"com.ctugames.km2","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ctugames.km2&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.Kraken.TinyWorlds":{"title":"Tiny Worlds: Dragon Idle games","description":"Your main mission, if you\u2019re up to it?

A HUGE update is available with a new Event and a lot of changes! Here&#39;s the changelog:<br>- New Summer Event! Collect watermelons to unlock the Leviathans!<br>- New pet animations and VFX<br>- Pet passives reworked and pet levels capped at 10<br>- Big game rebalancing to suit the above change<br>- New Pet UI page and sort options<br>- Eggs are now also collected within the offline rewards<br>- Numerous quality of life changes<br>- Various bugfixes","comments":["The game is great. Its got great graphics, theme, gameplay and etc. But there are 2 complaints... 1: it takes WAY too long to level up... why do you need to wait 2 seconds until you go to next world? Fix this and it would make me very happy. 2: there are some ads that are a entire minute long!?!? And also sometimes it makes me rewatch an ad to get the reward... Other than that, its great! No forced ads, no popups asking for money though if I could I would donate (sry).","This game is super fun! I keep it open sometimes just to get the presents as they go past! And the collection of eggs is very fun! I do wish there was more things to do in here though. Like side quests that will cycle through after you complete each one versus daily quests or more runes to collect. The events are amazing but I wish they were more frequent and I\'d really like more things to collect besides pets! But otherwise I love everything about this game and excited for what\'s next!","A decent enough game. Honestly the only reason it\'s not a 5 star one is because some of the mechanics feel very unfair. It\'s really frustrating when you miss downing a boss level because you pets are coded to move every few seconds and you lose that dps as they fly to the other side of the cube. Also absolutely pay to win, but you can still make decent progress if you don\'t.","The game itself is fun for an idle game, and progression is fast. My biggest issue (and the reason for the rating) is that ads often have multiple layers, all of which have up to 30 second timers before they can be skipped and still get rewards. I\'ve had multiple ads I\'ve had to wait 2 or even 3 30-second timers for to skip, and even then I have to fight the pin-sized button to actually skip it and not just open the app store by accident.","This game has a good concept and is fun to play. It has fun art and is relatively simple. However, it can be a bit complicated to understand at first. The dragons are a fun concept but aren\'t really functional to the game, as you can move forward quicker if you don\'t upgrade them. Also, I wish there was a way that you didn\'t have to go all the way back go level 75 when you \\"reset\\" levels. Maybe if you\'re far enough ahead, go back to the closest 100 level? Just a thought.

If you\'re killing time and on a WiFi connection it\'s passable. I\'m changing my rating to 1 star. It\'s only playable if you have WiFi, you spend more time watching ads than actually playing, and once you start leveling you have to lose roughly 3-4 matches before winning 1, unless of course you want to pay to win.","wasn\'t what I thought it would be, but that doesn\'t mean it is t as great as it is. there\'s still a couple things wrong which will happen with any game, but I really like the clean layout and gameplay. first of all I think there needs to be more cards, which I think the game devs are working one second, which will be big, maybe add a 3d model for when the cards hit each other? third, make the buff for having the same kinds of cards together more powerful.","This is a good game. My only issues are that coins and upgrade cards seem to be few and far between as you move up the ranks. also the amount of coin it takes to upgrade from blue to purple is high at 1k. The last thing is that the battles are still somewhat automated even when not using auto battle. I wish i had more control over which of my cards attacks when.","so i think the game is super fun and i really think that yall have a solid base that can be fine tuned and improved to be a super fun game. i just wish some of the mechanics were a little more thought out like being able to organize your cards to be able to see which characters belong to which faction. or put them in order based on their attack or health. this would be a big improvement and start to make the game a little more competitive. also different multiplayer modes would be nice too.","I\'ve only been playing this a short time. For someone looking for an in depth tcg this is not really you. This game is basic atack/initiative/health, and then each card character has a combo skill you do not control. Despite this I still give it a solid 4 because its smooth running, f2p is a valid option, and even though its basic as far as a tcg, Im still able to enjoy it for what it is. I would recommend to a casual player."],"appId":"com.noxgames.shadow.deck.card.ccg","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.noxgames.shadow.deck.card.ccg&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.pixelbite.ga2":{"title":"Reckless Getaway 2","description":"It ain\u2019t no cakewalk topping the most-wanted list.

I like the destructive aspect of it and it works well to let some steam off. The only thing I would like to see is more ways to spend the coins. Thanks to Google PlayPass, I have unlocked 95%of the vehicles so I really have no use for the coins now. It would be nice if we could buy powerups with the coins that you normally get from getting the purple question marks when playing the game. Overall fun game though.","this game has so much potential. i love the graphics, the driving is amazing, and all the vehicles are detailed in a way so you know what there are, one problem is the missions for each vehicle, and with that some of them are just way too tricky or can be impoosible. It can really cause players stress. other than that, there is nothing wrong with this game. Great job Dev.-Lil19","This is my 100% honest review, and I must start by saying I really do love this game a lot. The controls are nice, I like the auto gas idea as it adds to the challenge, I like the different vehicles you can get and the maps are cool, especially the farm. Ive completed nearly every challenge decently well and with practice... Except the flaming bike... Thats too hard imo. My one main issue is the car buying system... Did 50 draws and got zero new cars... So much time wasted. Overall good game!","Very fun. 84 different cars to collect, ranging from combine harvesters to sedans, this game has literally everything. Very easy to control, the maps are really well put together and the cars chasing you are really interesting, like cop cars and SWAT vehicles, tanks and hummers. You can collect power-ups, one is an explosion that knocks back every car around you, one is a mode where you are invincible and break everything you hit, and the last is jump boost. There are challenges, too.","Excellent concept with great potential. I love the run from the police concept, but I am disappointed about the upgrades, levels, achievements as they do not enhance gameplay. The controls are pretty painful and cumbersome. Your car will damage quickly and wreck within the first minute. Get different a different car doesn\'t help! None of the cars stay straight despite the type of cars that you can easily get because the coins are given so freely.

With plenty of content to boot with no predatory microtransactions. Why the low rating? The controls are horribly placed and lack configuration. It\'s genuinely hard to input the right key they\'re so tiny. With the ability to reconfigure and rescale controls, this game would be 5*/5*","Space Marshals 3 is an awesome game! I\'m a huge fan of the previous two Space Marshals games. The game seems to run better after Chapter 3 was released. In some parts, the game runs smooth at the highest graphics settings, but still suffers from reduced frame rate when the level is larger and more populated, even on high-end devices. Still, this did not deter me from playing. In my opinion, Space Marshals games are the best games on Google Play. They are fun, captivating, and have a great story.","I was super hyped for Space Marshals 3. I made it through Chapter 2 and had been waiting in the release of the next install for months. While I like the continuous nature of the story, I was disappointed that I went through Ch 3 so quickly. The challenges got more intense towards the end but bummed I beat the game & there isn\'t anything else to do in it. I hope there is a Space Marshals 4 coming. I haven\'t found a game that comes close to this one.","The game is so slow and glitchy that it\'s unplayable. I had it on my old phone back before part 3 came out and it worked well, an awesome game it was. Now, on my new phone, it\'s just so buggy and glitchy and slow that even if you spend the 20 minutes to get the first level to start, you can\'t do anything because it doesn\'t register your commands and then the game crashes. Pity, I did love the game.","I know that Space Marshals 1 was a premium game, and 2 had the premium upgrade for more checkpoints and exclusive unlockables... But I was really expecting more than 2 levels. You get to play the tutorial + level 1, then the rest of the game is $8 and an extra $3 for bonus bounty hunts. I would have rather been told to pay $8 up front, then had the option for the $3 expansion. I believe that first level doesn\'t give enough time for someone to decide if they enjoy the game."],"appId":"com.pixelbite.sm3","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pixelbite.sm3&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.biglime.cookingmadness":{"title":"Cooking Madness -A Chef\'s Game","description":"PREPARE \ud83d\udd2a, COOK \ud83d\udd51and SERVE \ud83c\udf55 delicious meals from all over the world \ud83c\udf0e in Cooking Madness! \\n \\nBecome the master chef \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udf73 you have always wanted to be!

Performance optimization<br>2. Bug fixed<br><br>Enjoy your journey in Cooking Madness and thanks for playing!","comments":["Some of the levels are specifically designed to be nigh on impossible unless you\'re willing to grind for coins or pay. Other levels (especially the timed plate ones) can sometimes be unwinnable entirely or 100% left up to chance (such as where the customers \\"stop\\" in their walk, as this determines how quickly you can begin to fill their order.) It\'s a fun game on the surface & the different environments are very interesting but it\'s so transparently a game designed to get money out of you.","I have to edit my review unfortunately. I\'m over 100 levels in and I can no longer say this isn\'t a pay-to-win game, which is a shame bc it IS very fun. I absolutely HAVE to buy \ud83d\udc8e in order to advance bc I\'ll be a mere 2 coins or 4 likes away from a goal after playing the same level several times. I have so many coins now I REALLY wish you could spend them on anything other than restaurant upgrades. You should be able to buy a booster with them at the very least. It takes way too long to earn \ud83d\udc8e","Easy and fun, not too difficult or stressful. All the ads weren\'t annoying until I paid to get them removed and still get ads to get double coins, mysterious gifts, etc which why am I paying to remove ads, but I still have to play ads to get bonuses or to instant upgrade my stuff? Definitely not a fan of that. If someone is paying to remove ads, then remove all ads \ud83d\ude44","The game is fun, nice design and graphics. However the flaws, so many ads it\'s insanity. I get it being free and the ads are what makes it that way but after everytime I finish a round and then if I want double coins I have to watch another one. Way to much! Secondly once you finish a restraunt level and make it 3 stars you can\'t even go back in and play it to make some extra coins for upgrades, or just practice to get better ext. May get deleted due to ads being to much.","This game is surprisingly decent for a free to play game, with the stipulation that you pay $1 to get rid of the ads. There is an energy system but your energy only depletes if you fail a level, and that\'s not super common. Some levels are hard and can take multiple attempts, but there are also ways to get infinite energy for a set duration of time. After playing 260 levels on this game, I have a lot of premium in-game currency as well, so I could buy help if I needed it."],"appId":"com.biglime.cookingmadness","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.biglime.cookingmadness&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.preus.PreusZombi":{"title":"100 DAYS - Zombie Survival","description":"\u25a0 Survival mode unlocked!\\n\u25a0 New items, stages and zombies!\\n\u25a0 Adjusted difficulty level.\\n\\n\u25a0 Synopsis\\nOnce an ordinary man, Peter is left to survive in midst of a zombie apocalypse.

It is time consuming. I do have a problem that when resolved I will change my review to a 5 star. The game is verifiably ad promoting for progress in game, however while I can watch the ads I never receive the award. I am unable to use the \\"reward granted X\\" button. Instead I have to push the back button on my phone which clears the ad and leaves the game screen frozen until I touch the screen. Then gameplay continues as normal just without the reward for the ad.","Plenty of potential here. The game itself is a good infinite grind concept, but the reward values for ad watching are completely off. it turns into a game of \\"literally wait until you have enough gold to pump Alice another level\\". Storage gives virtually no benefit at the cost of diamonds which is ridiculous. The only way this is playable is to stare at your screen with nothing going on until as I said, you pump Alice a level. Needs single use creeper drops and other add-ons to be more fun.","The game is fine, and can entertain for a while. I have struggle enjoying games with this kind of loop in mechanics, because it\'s short and too repetitive, so gets boring incredible fast. But does not help if the levels are too easy or super hard, they both are frustrating. And you manage to have them both, almost at the same time.","It\'s a really fun idle(ish) game. The whole idle part of it is really optional with how you progress. The animation is nice too. Survival mode is a really great addition as it progresses really well. Definitely worth checking out.","1.The game constantly struggles to run so you should get rid of the death animation on the zombies or maybe fix it so it can run more smoothly 2.the game has a massive problem. the upgrades cost too much. reduce the price of upgrades while still having it expensive. 3.add more modes the game is really bland after a while and it really needs new content"],"appId":"com.preus.PreusZombi","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.preus.PreusZombi&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.oxiwyle.alternativehistory20tgcentury":{"title":"20th century Economic strategy","description":"You wish to become an emperor, a king or a president?

The tutorial is underwhelming, I had to learn the functions of the majority of the menu through trial and error. You can\'t change from Switzerland until you accumulate 10,000,000 money. This wouldn\'t have been an issue if training troops didn\'t require more than two years of waiting. Hiring troops in any significant number costs 10,000s of dollars, setting you back severely if you need to fend off an attack. It keeps you stuck in a grind.","It\'s a really good game, one of the best of the mobile war games along with all their other games. Although there is a few problems, when war is prohibited it only effects the player, and all other countries can still attack you whenever wanted. Also it takes alot of adds to actually get far, I\'m fine with watching adds occasionally but they\'re pretty much required due to taxes having many negitive effects. I reccomend to either make the rewards for adds better or add alternative ways.","Great game, wonderfull RTS mechanics. It takes a little time to get a feel for the game but after playing for a few hours it\'s pretty casual to play. You have to keep track of the production of resources(food , building materials , natural resources and military equipment). Maintain relationships with your allies and engage in wars or be a beacon of peace in 20th century Europe.","I absolutely love this game. For people who like being managers in sports games or Civilization fans- this game will get you hooked. You have to get used to the navigation a bit at first but after that it\'s easy. I found the tutorial helpful. The game is about political & military decision making, not graphical war/combat action. The developing relationship scenarios with countries are fun, figuring out defensive alliances, trade etc. offer great strategy tools! I do recommend a new game name.","I don\'t really know what to say about this game - it\'s not a game I\'d be excited to play, but it is a fun game to play for passing the time, especially when I\'m in the car with no Internet, (I drive a lot). I will however send you an email of some things to consider adding, and if you do add these things, I might change my mind about this game."],"appId":"com.oxiwyle.alternativehistory20tgcentury","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.oxiwyle.alternativehistory20tgcentury&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.oxiwyle.kievanrusageofcolonization":{"title":"Age of Colonization","description":"Age of Colonization: Economic strategy is an exciting geopolitical strategy people play in the whole world.

I understand that these kinds of games could be slow but the rate at which this game progressed, it made even the smallest of task extremely long. This game does not play in the background either which makes it even more annoying to play. Overall has great potential, just the speed at which the game progresses needs work.","interesting game so far, it\'s keeping my interest well enough. My only major complaint is the fact that the tutorial really only covered the absolute basics, then threw me into the game. thankfully I\'ve played a lot of games similar enough that I was able to learn the menus and mechanics pretty quickly. Definitely explore all the menus and read everything thoroughly. there\'s a lot of miniscule details that can have dire consequences.","Strategy based for sure with much to consider. In fact you can become very involved within the many aspects of the overall picture of the game. Its enjoyable if you\'re into very strategic, time based, cerebral gaming. Its not a big money grab as most are now. You get a lot out of it but you must put quite a bit of time thinking out your overall game plan. So if you\'re into such games it won\'t disappoint!","ATTENTION DEVELOPERS: Good game but it could be better. It would be nice if you could play online (multi-player) as well, also it needs more countries. If you could choose between different periods of time it would help a lot. It needs an \\"easy\\"/\\"hard\\" mode.","Thought a game about colonization would involve the Americas guess I was wrong....don\'t get me wrong it an amazing game and the did a great job just wish I could set up colonies in the Americas before the British and create my own empire up in the Americas \ud83d\ude01 also something that I dislike about all your games is the inability to change your flag...I can change my country\'s name and the capitals name but I can\'t change the flag!

The game is fun, having 5 different environments is super fun, and the different animals are fun as well (haven\'t had the chance to try the giraffe yet though. One minor thing which prevented me from giving 5 stars is that after 20 or 30 games you will start to feel it\'s repititive, I know this is expected from such games but still, it is repititive :(","A little bothersome with all the ad pop-ups and encouragement to leave a review, but overall a good version of a classic running away game. Pretty easy controls, only problem is it doesn\'t always register them in time--plan to jump early. Fluid graphics, a few funny cut scenes. I\'d give it a solid 4.5, just wish there weren\'t so many ads.","It\'s a fun game. I just dont like going to the beach, or that the coconuts fall randomly when you are at the beach which annoyed me so much that I deducted one star, along with the fact that you can\'t watch an ad or something to get a Golden Heart, you either have to buy them with real money or complete missions. And it takes you a relatively long time to complete missions. Edit: There are rarely any ads.","Super addictive and fun. Beautiful visuals. My one wish is that revival hearts are more easily obtained (or that player gets, say, 3 revivals per play). Update: I got every hat, parachute, power-up, and animal upgrade and had a surplus of 200k bananas. The missions got buggy, showed as completed from the outset. Uninstalled and reinstalled...now (happily) starting again from scratch. \ud83d\ude03","I absolutely LOVE this game, I played this like 4 or 5 years ago or 6, I like this WAYY more better then donkey Kong 2, cause this one is nostalgic and so much more fun, but I won\'t say donkey Kong 2 is bad. But it\'s a little harder then the first one and the music is boring, but still it\'s a good game as well, I rate this game 5 stars, I also LOVE red ball 4, it\'s my second favourite, I made t to the moon boss level, still trying to beat it"],"appId":"com.fdgentertainment.bananakong","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fdgentertainment.bananakong&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.FDGEntertainment.BananaKong2.gp":{"title":"Banana Kong 2: Running Game","description":"Celebrate with us the return of Banana Kong!\\nWe worked hard to create a worthy sequel for both fans and new players.\\n\\nRun, jump, bounce and swing on vines while traversing *new* forests, caves, treetops, lagoons and even the north pole!\\n\\nAll your animal friends are back and there\'s so much more:\\nHow about hopping onto a penguin to slide on snowy slopes or riding ocean waves on a surfboard?

So simple yet so good. This game is also great. The graphics don\'t look like a mobile game because they are so good. But my main problem is really with the fact that everything has changed and that isn\'t a bad thing. But I wish all the different areas could still be reached with the power dash but now its by hopping into cannons and minecarts. It is fun but I wish it retained some old features. The new music is great too.","Really great game compared to the first one. Visuals and gameplay are pretty entertaining. I think what would make this even better though is a story mode, with levels, bosses, characters and what not. For now, completing missions is the main objective which can get overused.","ADS. Otherwise, it\'s a cute, side-scrolling endless run, featuring the famous Banana Kong! Even if you don\'t know who he is, like me \ud83d\ude05, the game is still cute and fun to try. Relatively smooth gameplay, cute graphics and good musics and sound effects (not that great for headphones). Until the ads drive you crazy. Or you realize, endless runner is not (or no longer) your genre. Has Google Play Achievements and Cloud-save, although I can\'t find where to check them in-game (but they do exist).","This game is really nice! I am one of the first people who played this game and I must say, I really like it, the way you all, the developers, headed for a 3D perspective is good. Though I think you all can do some optimizations. First of all, you can make the textures of the background lower resolution and make the game even more lower resolution(According the the device\'s specifications)And then add MSAA or FXAA on higher settings, so that the game can run faster and kids won\'t even notice.","Amazing tribute to one of my favorite games of all time: Donkey Kong Country!!! Excellent job from the development team. Animation is really awesome, soundtrack is on point and some sound effects are a remix and tribute to Donkey Kong, UI is really well made...I really have nothing negative to say other than as all endless runner it can get boring at some point! Thank you for having this game available for free, wish you all the best for the future!!!"],"appId":"com.FDGEntertainment.BananaKong2.gp","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.FDGEntertainment.BananaKong2.gp&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.FDGEntertainment.RedBallRunner":{"title":"Red Ball Super Run","description":"Red Alert!\\nThe evil square minions are back and they wreak havoc everywhere.\\n\\nThe world calls out for the Red Ball Super Running Heroes!\\nRun, Roll, Dodge and Dash through an all-new and exciting Red Ball endless running adventure.\\nComing from the team behind the original smash hit Red Ball 4.\\n\\n- Chase through the streets with one of 4 playable Red Ball super heroes.\\n- Run and Dodge obstacles to gain speed.\\n- Jump on enemies to defeat them -

I just started using the basic one yesterday, but it has already helped me see directly what I need to do at the gym and the goals obtained for the day. Setting up the training program is super easy and I love the fact that one can change, add or delete and adjust as necessary, right after doing each exercise. Superbly thought out and easy to use! Great job!","I\'ve been using rep count for three years now and I have only ever been overwhelmingly satisfied. I absolutely love all the statistics and how easy it is to make and customize workouts and exercises. The app\'s creator is also fantastic. I noticed a slight bug in the app so I emailed him and he fixed it a few updates later. I cannot recommend this app enough!","I love this app so much. For all of the people complaining about the lack of pre-loaded exercises: it\'s meant to be FLEXIBLE. You get to add and edit exercises, which I love\u2014it really let\'s me make my own routines. I love that I can leave notes for myself on specific days or exercises, because I\'ll sometimes have forgotten why I made a change by the next time I get to that exercise and I can use this as a reminder. I\'ll be getting the premium sometime this year for sure and I can\'t wait!","I\'ve been using the premium version of this app for years and it\'s fairly simple to use and has done job for my clients and I. Some features differ from android to iPhone which can be inefficient sometimes. Also, the graphs may be a bit complicated to read and navigate depending on who you are but if you just want to log your workouts and keep track of your overall volume and exercises, this is fine.","Pretty cool app, I love that I can just enter the workout that I want without having to deal with some pre-filled template. It also automatically records how long your sessions are, you just set when you ended. It also automatically saves your entries as you make them, that is just awesome! I just wish it weren\'t a subscription service, I prefer to just buy access with a one-time payment."],"appId":"sp.repcount","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=sp.repcount&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.imaginalis.HouseFlipperMobile":{"title":"House Flipper: Home Design","description":"Have you ever dreamed about running your own renovation company?

I love this game, and it provides a lot for a free to play game - it\'s fun, consistently updated, and you can tell it\'s loved. The problem is the pay wall. The game requires FlipCoins to unlock new items and to upgrade your tools. You can earn them through achievements, leveling up, and real world money. I\'ve put money into the game, and I\'m glad because it meant supporting them. I just wish that after paying $10 I didn\'t have to keep paying","I love all the different styles of items, tiles, paints, etc. I wish their was an easier way to unlock them all. The gameplay flows smoothly, and it\'s easy to lose track of time. The game can be played without paying real money for it, but that\'s harder and can be frustrating. Overall, great game for relaxing.","Excellent mobile game. Relaxing, addicting, game play is smooth. I like having the option to skip installation sequences for free and that the game immediately highlights what to purchase to complete tasks when you queue up the menu. I don\'t like having to wait four (4) hours for the task reward by default; you can get payment sooner in exchange for flipcoins, but they are not plentiful in game, so it\'s not ideal to do that too often. Otherwise, great job so far.","really so much better than I expected. really smooth graphics and gameplay, the variety of tasks is good, and being able to design your own properties with earned money is super rewarding. accessibility is also great; there\'s an option to skip some of the more repetitive tasks, you can toggle off bug visuals in case of a phobia, and overall it\'s easy and fun even with hand and wrist mobility issues.","At first, the game feels like you\'re more of a professional cleaner than a home fixer upper, but eventually you get into actual fixing, but you have no control the design for the clients, which is a bit annoying. Once you do finally get into your own homes to fix and flip, you\'ve basically ran out of flip coins and you\'re forced to buy them, not cool. The achievements eventually end and don\'t give a fair amount for work done... only 1 flip coin for buying a house??"],"appId":"com.imaginalis.HouseFlipperMobile","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.imaginalis.HouseFlipperMobile&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.rayark.cytus2":{"title":"Cytus II","description":"\\"Cytus II\\" is a music rhythm game created by Rayark Games.

It has a large song selection and a really great story that keeps you hooked all the way through. I usually only play rythm games for the game play bit the story was amazing. The dlc content is plentiful so if you liked the game and want more content, it\'s there. The only reason it\'s 4 stars for me is the framerate on my device. I play on my phone and there are no graphics settings so framerate sometimes struggles leading to like 50 random misses.","I was very skeptical when my friend told me to get this game. I never got rhythm games before, because I thought They would be too difficult. But My friend convinced me to buy the gave anyway. And I have been a convert ever since. The developers did a good Job of including alot of different songs and levels. So I can improve and move on at my own pace. Also the store line is pretty fun. Get the game! It\'s good!","I absolutely adore this game!! \u2764\ufe0f Tho I have had the benefit of spending a pretty penny on the game, it is enjoyable even without spending money on it, story line is very interesting but a tad difficult to understand. But go for it! It gets easier over time! Tho I recommed useing a bigger screened device, even with a very big mobile screen is it difficult, also make sure to have storage open if you do end up buying song packs and characters, because you gotta download to play offline!:)","one of the best rhythm games I\'ve ever played. Fantastic gamplay, HUGE list of songs, all of which are bangers, and an amazing storyline that builds on and Greatly expands upon the first game\'s, with a whole bunch of fantastic characters and a creative way of telling the story. An absolute MUST for rhythm game fans, or just anyone who enjoys a good intricate story.","Simply a fun experience if you\'re musically inclined or are up for a slight challenge. I would say it is easy enough to start, though do try to give the learning curve a shot... It\'s addicting beyond reason. I personally purchased all of the DLC but it is still just as fun with just the basic experience. If you\'re a fan of a deep storyline, well good for you!! This rhythm game actually has a damn good story!! (If you don\'t snatch the songs/difficulty upgrade and leave).

Either way, it\'s still a fun time killer. Definitely check it out if you\'re a fan of Noodlecake\'s other games.","I like this game. It\'s a simple concept that\'s surprisingly difficult to master. The art style is fun, and the music is...really great. I just wish there was a way to progress more. Maybe the ability to upgrade powerups, or unlock new bouncer characters with different abilities/attributes? It\'s just that the game can get really repetitive, and once you set a decently high score, it\'s REALLY difficult to get back to that level. So, you know, it\'s hard to feel like you\'re actually doing anything.","Man this game is so simple and yet so much fun, all the while being frustratingly addictive. One thing though, I know its a free game and y\'all gotta make money somehow, but there are some ads that once I press the close button, they stay stuck for 5-10 seconds. Otherwise a 5 star game/app.","One of the simplest most fun games I\'ve ever played, cought my attention quickly and is a good challenge. Only issue is there are ads after every 2 games but they\'re skippable and if you\'re good enough you\'ll be playing each game for a few minutes anyway. Very very good game","Absolutely amazing endless game. Super addicting! You really get a different experience every time you play. There a randomness that keeps it interesting but at the same time I take concentration and skill to get the highest score.

It\'s SO CHALLENGING that\'s its frustrating because you get so close to beating your high score, to just completely eating it and having to start over. You end up playing over & over again out of pure frustration! It\'s not too challenging that you never want to play again, in fact, it\'s quite the opposite! Download the game! You\'ll love it!","I loved this game a lot! But today, I witnessed so many bugs or I don\'t know what\'s the problem, but every time I close the game and restart, all my scores and achievements are just GONE! My highest score was above 2000, and now it\'s gone. Also, some of the monsters are in slow motion which is not feeling good to me. One more thing, the IOS version of the game has the little tracking blue triangle monster from so long and I want it in this game! Please fix these issues, I want my scores back!","And sometimes only the orange obstacles closing too soon (the second obstacle like a ladder but moving like waves) I can\'t pass it because it\'s closing too soon and too fast. It\'s impossible to pass it. It\'s open too slow compare to the speed of the high score.","Hello \ud83d\udc4b I think that it\'s a great game but the blue monsters are annoying \ud83d\ude05 but it\'s okay because they give a bit of a challenge \ud83d\ude02 maybe if you add different modes like upside-down or like dark mode and we can only see through a small circle so that we\'ll try and focus more. Also you can put like in the hard mode like a red monster before we start the match not a green one & an online mode would be nice like a race or something \ud83c\udfc1 Idk you\'ll figure it out \ud83d\ude02. Thank you so much for reading \ud83e\udd70.","Awesome game to pass time and much harder than it seems. It is the complete opposite of pay to win as well, a feature I\'m very happy with.

Please solve these problems because it is really not suitable for a unique application like this, well done everyone and keep up the great work!","Good app, only problem I have with it is that if I select a Xbox pack, like the battle royale one, you would expect to get Xbox games for your premium lootcard if you didn\'t get vbucks, but no. It gives you px games on it, fix that and well, 5 stars.(edit: apparently my review was misunderstood. What I mean is, yes every card isn\'t a hit, but you shouldn\'t get pc games while opening an Xbox pack. You should get Xbox games from an Xbox pack, and vice versa.","I take back my previous 3 star review. They\'ve completely revamped it, they operate on a seperate provider for the in game offers now which makes it 100X better. They have redesigned a lot of the UI, and have integrated ads (the banner ads you can scroll past) to help support the funding of the app. Looks like you\'re definitely heading in the right direction! 5 star easily now","When I\'m trying to sign up every time I click the login button or something once I\'ve put in my details it just reloads the app like nothing has happened.

That being said it is a very atmospheric game that is fun and well thought out. I enjoy playing it. There are some things I think should be changed like the \\"retard\\" mode which seems a bit unnecessary.","Even better than 60 seconds! The more you play the more features you can get. The only issue is that the wiki doesn\'t explain any mechanics - only entities and hints on the endings. I had my people die multiple times with no apparent reason, even when I had them at full health, food, and water. It would be great if we could see the death reason in the journal! Also the constant knocking gets a little annoying :/ A notification icon would be better!","If you want 60 seconds but arent willing to pay, this game is perfect! It\'s like 60 but possibly a bit more complicated, and I\'m always up for a challenge! It has a whole cult aspect with the monks and their missions, which I really enjoy. This game is overall great and worth the download! (Not to mention there are multiple endings! Love that!)","This really is a 5 star game. It\'s a really fun indie game where a nuke is about to be dropped and you have to collect items before it\'s too late. Then as the title shows, you have to survive in a bomb shelter. There are a ton of different things that happen and ways to get rescued. Has different difficulties too so don\'t worry. This is probably one of the best mobile indie games there is, especially for free. I honestly recommend that you try it. (: have a great day :)","This indie puzzle game actually turned out better than what I expected, I like how every choice you make effects the day. Only problem I have is the new update, I love it and all but I dont like the new bugs all too much...every time i try to sleep for the next day the app crashes.

The bad news is the controls are awkward, the maps feel repetitive even when they aren\'t, the quests are the same every time, the Abomination quest target never shows up, and no matter your class, the boss after the first 8 levels WILL crush you like a bug. Sure, you probably could grind levels 1-8 over and over until you\'re strong enough to beat it, but the gameplay isn\'t interesting enough to make you want to.","I\'ve been playing this game a few years and I always come back to it. It\'s the only proper Diablo successor I\'ve found. I was waiting so long for Diablo immortal, but it plays itself for you. In Anima you actually make choices with your character development that affect gameplay. I\'ve also spent some money on cosmetic stuff, but it\'s definitely not pay 2 win and there are no advertisements or bugging you too spend money. Amazing game!","The game is great, classes are fun, bosses are interesting, and many trials and levels to grind when the main line has you hitting a brick wall. That said, this game has frozen very frequently, completely crashing but has me stuck at a frozen screen and even crashed my phone once. I play wild rift, and other online games with no issue, so its not my hardware. Please fix.","The game keeps on starting and stopping every time I try to play it now. I beat it on normal but the game is so entertaining that I wanted to play it on a more difficult setting and that\'s when all the problems had started. I love the game but can you guy\'s please fix this problem. It never did until I started over on a harder level. Thank you","AnimA is an old school ARPG grinder to get gear to beat stronger enemies to get better gear ad infinum. It\'s a very fun game with 6 different classes, but requires buying a bundle to hold more than 2 characters and a slot of storage. The bundles are cheap enough, and aren\'t required if you wish to play without spending, but there are some beneficial things that will make you better locked behind a pay wall. Overall though, This is the game Diablo Immortal should have been! 4.5/5"],"appId":"com.ExiliumGames.Anima","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ExiliumGames.Anima&hl=en&gl=us"},"air.com.luni.animearcade":{"title":"Anime Arcade!","description":"Welcome to Anime Arcade!

I also had this notification after a few mins of trying to get in anime arcade. It always would say \\"Anime Arcade! is not responding\\" if you may fix it, I would be happy. Luni I know you never made a new app or updated an app, I\'m just not happy your not working on your games so please update or fix your games.","Every time I try to play it tells me that it\'s for an older device and then it crashes and says \\"Anime Arcade! is not responding.\\" And every time I try it does not work. For over a year people have been reviewing the game asking for you to update it so everyone can play on devices that weren\'t made in like, 2006 and you\'re just ignoring the reviews. Please fix it.","I feel like the game is difficult and too fast paced. At the beginning of each game it should start out slow and steadily speed up. Personally I had a really bad experience with the bad controls. I\'ve never rated a game this bad, it was sort of a shock to see a game this bad.","This isn\'t worth it. I haven\'t played this in a while, but I don\'t need to in order to say that these minigames are bad. That, combined with the fact that a few of them are behind cheap paywalls and some are plain broken (lookin\' at YOU, Flappy Bird knockoff), just drives me away more. The art isn\'t that great, but that\'s excusable, since it\'s gotten better in subsequent games, but the minigames have gotten... slightly better. They aren\'t broken to high hell anymore, but they aren\'t anymore fun.","It keeps crashing...Im on a newer version of android and every time I open it it crashes.

Other than that, Awesome game, keep working on it please!","The game has alot to offer as well as alot of potential. I love the variety in choices on moves and clothing, and they add more every once in a while which is nice. I love that there\'s no tutorial because its fun and rewarding to figure out how to do things like use your second special move or double jump. But, the only tiny problem I have is, you need to get a new body type already. The old one is boring. Start with a simple female body, then work your way to more complex body types.","I absolutely love this game, but I have a few tid bits: If we could get something like Broly\'s wig when he\'s not transformed entirely (broly movie, 2018), that would help give more diversity to the hairstyles for transformed characters. It would also be cool to get custom items like Erbito\'s aura, effects, and hair textures for T1 and T2. And finally, give each character transform slots. I keep having to delete characters because I want a new form. Other than that, this game deserves a download","The game is amazing, definitely one of the best 2D fighting mobile games I\'ve seen, but there is a bug that prevents you from unlocking a specific necklace-type item and another that makes me have to repurchase certain effects or clothing items. I never encountered it the last time I had the game installed but I should mention that once you equip one of the bugged items, assuming you have the same bug, you only have to re-buy it after you unequip it following saving the cac changes.","What they all say is true. This IS the best mobile fighting game. It DOES have amazing customization. The shockwave combo DOESN\'T connect easily (but that\'s the little things). Please, if anyone sees this review, just show it to everyone. This game needs more popularity and higher ratings than it has. On another note, I think it would be great if these were added: 1. A U.S. server 2. Female customization. 3. Bow/arrow-related attacks 4. Stats that can be increased with points.

Although this game is really not boring but you should make more updates and gamemodes. I was thinking sandbox mode or online or even a 3 team mode. Just giving you ideas for updates. I really couldn\'t get passed icy hills or the last level but I understand that because it\'s the last 2 levels.","Amazing all around. It can get a bit repetitve with the tournaments but with weekly challenges its replayable. For some reason i only get 5 gems for beating a level when i see baronvongames get 60? I know he has infinity fan pack but dont think it gives you that nuch better rewards. The gear is hyper expensive but still possible to get without spending a penny. The ads are barely an issue since the levels are long and the ads are like 5 seconds and only play after beating a level. I recommend.","I personally find this game very fun to play in my free time, it\'s offline, has missions to play, an endless deads mode, a campaign, upgradable troops, special troops and abilities, etc. I rate this game a five star, though I think it could use a little more troops like the chaos and elemental factions including a larger campaign or unique campaign for each faction, but that\'s about it. 5 stars go to this game.","Very good game. I first started playing back when campaign, tournament, and endless deads were the only gamemodes. While I may not be the best at strategy, I found the campaign fairly easy. However this is coming from someone who hasn\'t played any difficulty higher than normal. I haven\'t found any bugs during my time of playing either, and it\'s great seeing the game updated from time to time too.","Amazing game, great replayability, I\'m surprised by how well skins fit into this. PS. Skins are easily collected via chests, power ups are even easier, and the screen tips are very helpful. That being said, I feel I wouldn\'t have a chance of finishing if my device lagged. Many 1 star reviews reflect the impossibly of playing this game with a horrid device.(ps, my phone is new but bottom of the market, with multiple background apps running 24/7, this still works perfectly.)"],"appId":"com.maxgames.stickwarlegacy","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.maxgames.stickwarlegacy&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.wildlifestudios.free.online.games.suspects":{"title":"Suspects: Mystery Mansion","description":"You have been invited to solve a murder mystery at the mansion!\\n\\nPlay online with other 9 real players as you try to solve the mysterious murder.

Most of the time, I just die when I leave, either due to the killer or disconnection. Another issue is that people are constantly saying slurs, which I don\'t appreciate, but I can\'t really do anything about that.","It\'s a amazing game I love that u can talk to the others in the game with out any calling apps. The only thing that is a problem is that I can\'t join the people I have friended when there in a game, witch means if I friend them there\'s no point cause most likely I won\'t join there game again plus the lag so when I\'m walking around I get teleported back to a place I was before and if in doing a task and that happens I have to do the task all over again. That\'s all my opinion.","This is my favorite game and I\'ve been playing for a year now, I love all the characters and how the gold pass you can earn instead of just buying it. The ads for me are not to bad it\'s just when I\'m joining a match it gives me 3. The game modes are my favorite since in some you can chat while not in the meeting and the different things you can do as killer(as in poisoner) or getting to be team wars. I also like the friend system. This game has brought me so much joy, thank you for making this.","Well, I really like the game, the mic is a very good feature, it is funny too, sometimes. But uh, the lag is a problem. It has gotten better overtime, but it is still there, i\'d say I like it more than among us because of the fact that it has a mic, gamemodes, cool avatars, nice design, and interesting tasks. Anyways, I hope this review was helpful. Thanks ~Jayce daniel.","This seems like it has a ton of potential, but I can\'t rate it 5 stars in its current state. Controls, animations, ans tasks feel fluent and well-done, but the map can be slightly confusing. Also, there\'s a huge language barrier going on in a lot of servers I\'ve joined. I would suggest making servers for each language rather than an all-in-one mix. I haven\'t experienced anything rude yet, but the other reviews do make a good point about having a report system!

What makes it special is the many wacky vehicles you can choose from, with situations such as a bicycle fighting a tank or a plane chasing an ice cream truck. I think people would love the idea of manual upgrades for the vehicles, since you can only have the choice to upgrade a vehicle if you get it twice from the prize machine. Sometimes it can feel like a hassle to get gems, so there should be a gem reward for players who complete all the daily missions.","The game is loveable with easy simple controls. It\'s very easy to play and entertains for hours. It really is one of the best games I have ever played. The newer game modes are great. I miss the mansion map. It loses a star because the game freezes sometimes or a button or control disappears but is easily fixed by restarting the game. The cloud save is sort of buggy, it doesn\'t always say the right day of the last save, also I got a new phone and only saved half my progress so I lost 50 levels:(","This is a great game for easy controls, few ads, and a wide variety. You can get cars that you like and are more fun that change the game a little for you and your opponents. the game it self is great for simple but nice graphics and maps that add different mechanics to the game. it is simple to understand and addictive, easy 5 stars.","This is an amazing game and it is one of my favorite games! I am on chromebook where most games either have bad controls or don\'t work, but crash if cars makes my controls better by making them a, d, and space. This way I can play perfectly with one hand! I would suggest this to anyone who wants a fun and entertaining game to play, I play hours on end!","Really fun and great game. However, when my internet is down and I can only play offline mode, the bots on offline mode don\'t feel like they provide a challenge. Maybe add the option to change the difficulty of the bots, like being able to choose skill level and rarities of the cars bots spawn as. Another problem I run into is the game saying I\'m not connected to the internet when I clearly am. I can play online, but I can\'t get new car quests because the game says I\'m offline.

I don\'t remember this game having such an absurd amount of features locked behind a pay wall. Almost everything in the game must be purchased with real USD, it\'s ridiculous. Why not charge $4.99 - $6.99 for the game and make all of the levels unlockable through challenges/missions? The game is really fun, I just can\'t rate it well when I only have access to 10% of the game that I paid for! Not happy overall.","It\'s fun and all, I just really wish this game supported landscape mode during regular gameplay without needing to be connected to something. I would also love to see multiplayer in this game, it would be fun seeing people doing tricks in real time. There\'s also a bug when the skateboard disappears, leaving the wheels, including the character dissapears as well, and everytime you crash, your character appears but is completely black.","It\'s actually a really fun game, with awesome controls, but the downside you can\'t ignore are the massive paywalls. Decks, other parks, bolts, you get a single free park and the few others cost WAY too many bolts for the amount you can earn. I\'ll admit, the prices are pretty cheap, but it\'s the principal. My only other gripe is that the \\"ensure you\'re satisfied\\" custom grip tape notification is right in the way of the tape, so you can\'t see if it looks okay until you\'ve paid the 10k.","Game is perfect for skateboarders, however the new physics version I find to be more difficult than real life. It\'s almost impossible to do any 360 variant or double flips without using a ramp to give you more airtime. 360 flips and double flips are easy tricks for experienced skaters ON FLAT GROUND but nearly impossible in this game unless you go back to the original physics which feel like I\'m skating at 0 gravity.","Good graphics, great grind physics, easy to learn controls. Overall a great game. Just one problem. It seems after a couple of purchases you make, the game glitches out and doesn\'t let you press the \\"Me\\" button anymore. Every time you do, the game instantly crashes. If this problem where fixed, it would be an easy 5 star."],"appId":"com.trueaxis.trueskate","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.trueaxis.trueskate&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.prty.hpz":{"title":"HAPPY ZONE - Battle Royale","description":"Online Battle Royale with thousands of players from all over the world!

Love everything about it. This game doesnt force ads on you and you dont need to buy gold or gems to advance as they are given to you easily through quest or advancing to the next league. Forging weapons and armor is pretty cool and how the different elements effect the customization of the items is pretty neat too. I just have an issue with the game crashing after about 5 or so matches. If that was fixed this game would be perfect","It\'s rock paper scissors with more rules. I thought this would be a 2d platform fighter game and was really looking forward to it just to be severely dissapointed. Please rebrand. We just need back and forth movement, jump hit and block buttons. Make this a fighter game please. You can enchant your attacks with elements if you still want to keep the rock paper scissors aspect of the game.","Amazing game. The graphics are phenomenal. It could pass as a PC game with these graphics and animation. The only thing I ask for is a feature that allows for recycling armor and weapons for parts, and a graphics level option. Overall amazing game","I give it 2 stars because the idea of the game is good however, it mainly depends on your luck. Like, you can never know what\'s the next move of your opponent leading you to choose randomly your next attack.

The arrows on the sides that open up for menus is perfect. The ability to multi click a building to get more options is brilliant! It completely solves the dragging a box with a mouse issue. Perfect solution for a tablet game. Really great user friendly layout. Oh, the game is great, too \ud83d\ude0e","I enjoy this game very much. It is one of the only games that you can actually command your troops where to attack when in battle. And on top of that you can build a base and see what you need to improve after looking at resent defends. You get to level up your attackers and the theme is great. I would totally recommend it. I have had no problems on the game but to be expected your device may have bugs so if you experience problems such as (running slow, can\'t touch screen,or wifi connection)dev","Amazing experience overall. The no wait times part is especially great, because it allows you to make last minute changes to your base layout. The expansions do get a little expensive after you buy them, so I would recommend turn the expansion prices down a notch. The battle system is great as well, being able to tell gods wich buildings to attack is great. One of the best strategy games I have ever encountered.","Absolutely Amazing! Easy to advance, doesn\'t take days to build stuff, its instant. i love the fact that you can customize your own base. and assist your teammates in real time! not really any downsides of the game, most players are nice, and is constantly updated, and the devs actually listen to feedback. i could go on and on. i love the game! great job to the devs.","Really like the game. Good casual game that avoids the pay to win travesty of most other strategy games. Great team work, very little is taken from you that you\'ve earned except for maybe time you spend helping your team. You get rewarded by helping more and the hero battle system is fun. I\'d say only issue I have is progression isn\'t very clear, lots to upgrade, but hard to tell what the actual benefits are to your attack & defense. Overall excellent game, I\'m enjoying it a lot."],"appId":"com.aegisinteractive.goo","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aegisinteractive.goo&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.aanz.ludo.online.multiplayer.offlineludo":{"title":"Ludo Online Multiplayer Game","description":"Ludo Redefined \ud83c\udfb2 Online Ludo game is a classic dice board game loved by people all across the world. \ud83c\udfb2\\n\\nDownload Ludo multiplayer online to play an online Ludo game with friends.
