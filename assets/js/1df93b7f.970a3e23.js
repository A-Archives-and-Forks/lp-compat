The last couple months tho have been upsetting because the game would often glitch and crash resulting in stuff I earned to not be there next I open the app. I updated it recently and it was smooth sailing for a week and now it\'s starting to crash again.","Disclaimer that I played this game to receive rewards in a different game. It was fun, and I was able to acquire 100 dragons within the time limit in order to receive all rewards. Overall totally recommend this game (rewards or not). I especially like the levels and other side games, where other merge games only have the \\"camp\\" aspect. What I don\'t like is the graphics aren\'t that great, and when collecting items it usually puts them in random places rather than near similar ones.","I really enjoy this game... It\'s something I do while I listen to audiobooks \ud83d\ude05 I DO wish we had the options of having an inventory of special/hard to achieve items without cluttering our land or having to sell the item off.i feel like that would be an awesome improvement. The game makers have always been very responsive to my issues I\'ve had over the years I\'ve been playing (at least 3 significant problems arose that they fixed for me).","I really liked this game a while back but had to stop. I came back after a long hiatus and still enjoy it. One problem that was not remedied by the latest fix is the saves. Not only is my previous game not saved, but errors in coins and bricks in my little vaults are showing up as well. I spend the coins and bricks, but what I purchased has mysteriously vanished from my previous game. Not cool.","I sporadically play. I\'ve noticed since this most recent update that merge chains are overly sensitive to trigger when I don\'t want them to (pulls items that are diagonal and not directly in contact for example). I\'ve also noticed that there is a lot more lag both in my camp and in level... but a LOT more during levels. These two issues are so frustrating that it impacts my ability to enjoy it."],"appId":"com.gramgames.mergedragons","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gramgames.mergedragons&hl=en&gl=us"},"uk.fiveaces.nsfc":{"title":"New Star Manager","description":"*** The #1 game in AppSpy.com\'s Top 10 of 2018! ***\\n\\nWelcome to New Star Manager: The critically acclaimed game from Simon Read, creator of the BAFTA Award-winning New Star Soccer series.\\n\\nTake control of New Star FC \u2013 a beleaguered soccer club which needs your management skills and instincts to unlock the team\'s potential and make it to the top of the game.\\n\\n   \u201cIf you love football\u2026you\u2019d be mad not to download it\u201d The\xa0Guardian\\n\\nThis is soccer management like you\'ve never experienced it - Be more than just a player, be the head, the heart, and backbone of New Star FC.

There are numerous moments in-game where your assistant manager pitches in with advice which can help. The complexity does impede on gameplay too much for me but worth a try if you\'re a fan of this type of management in your football games. After giving it a go am sticking with NSS as there is just way too much to deal with here.","I never leave in actual worded review on anything but I have been playing this game for quite a while now and it\'s amazing. To anyone saying you need to buy cards to keep up, I just beat Champ league brentford while still in league2 with a 35 avg team. It\'s not easy by any means, but its possible. Like any team game, just know who your Strikers are, make sure every player gets at least some playing time, and pick and choose who gets training and when. Great game overall!","The game is extremely fun. The amount of stuff you have to take into account can be overwhelming, but it\'s a good challenge. The game play is good as well. Dribbling is kind of awkward because you have to pull back but then it\'s hard to stop and pass without going into shooting mode and hitting cancel. Progress through the bottom league is good, but the moment you get promoted your toast. You have to buy players because you\'ll barely get any scoring attempts in the second leave with you mid 30/low 40 players. You loss and everyone will be unhappy. I\'d be willing to buy a pack, but the 1, 2, or 3 players you\'d get for $10 will not make a difference with the rest of your squad being so low and not having any depth.","Good game, ruined by need to buy cards. Been playing nss for years and played this one now and then. The gameplay itself is great and hard to put down when you get into it. However, I am sick of losing by 1 goal no matter how many I get and all concern bars filling up, leading to poor play and losing key players after a few seasons. The entire experience and team frustratingly falls apart after a few good days play and is basically a waste of time.","Honestly great game but it still has its flaws. One is that you can\'t bend the ball nearly as well as you could in new star soccer. This makes it nearly impossible to hit free kicks and honestly this causes free kicks to put you in a worse situation. It piles defenders into the box and with no way to shoot you have to pass and hope you can get a scoring opportunity with 7 defenders in the box. But besides this and having to tank the second season because you aren\'t anywhere near good enough to be where you get promoted to this game is great."],"appId":"uk.fiveaces.nsfc","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.fiveaces.nsfc&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.pixelbite.xwt":{"title":"Xenowerk Tactics","description":"Play the first part for free.

I\'d love to be able to edit the squad formation or at least make em closer or further apart. Runs smoothly n looks great I wish I could zoom in a greater amount to enjoy it more. An the invisible enemy stages in the beginning are brutal without the cage shield n other abilities. It\'s been challenging, I like the world map and its random events.","Overall good game! Devs would you look into the pathfinding? Sometimes when I DoubleClick a spot one of my ops will get stuck somewhere... Also different environments in the woods when we have to engage and kill monsters... I don\'t like the auto-shooting... Maybe you guys could have an option to turn it on/off?? Game looks really good! No lag or crashes ... I have my game settings on high and it\'s doing amazingly! \ud83d\ude0a one more thing, could you add a normal mode? Only easy & hard available atm...","Games actually disappointing. I got interested in this game due to another game they produced, Space Marshals 2. That, absolutely love so let\'s see what else they got. The mix of old school 80s animation and computer graphics, does NOT work here. Plus random events via cards, it should simply happen and not be a card draw situation. A better way to have a functional tutorial and yet be a \\"make sense,\\" in game flow: have people in the team do backstory missions. You see their abilities.","Enjoying and engaging gameplay. You gear and deploy a 3 man squad (maybe more later in game?) The squad members gain random useful traits/mutations as they level up. Many of these are very cool to use. In a more expensive game I would ask for more classes and maybe branching weapon selections for the squad to add more strategy but as it is, its a great experience for the price. I also am a fan of using the cards to showcase most of the information as they do most of the time here.","I paid for it after the demo period thinking there would be more substance, but there isn\'t. I find that there are too few enemies and too few abilities to really change things. It has a gameplay loop similar to XCOM with combat being more fast-paced. Easy was a bit of a mindless slog. Turned it up to Hard (there is no Normal), and the randomized abilities cause a lot of early game forced losses as it becomes too easy to be overwhelmed and you don\'t have any abilities to do anything about it."],"appId":"com.pixelbite.xwt","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pixelbite.xwt&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.pixelbite.mutant":{"title":"Xenowerk","description":"Be the last hope against the mutant infestation.

It has micro-transactions (which I despise) but they were done correctly and not at all a nuisance. The gameplay loop is a solid, pick up and play for a few minutes one. The only reason I give it 4 stars is that all the levels are essentially visually the same. They\'re detailed and look good though, so it\'s only a minor complaint, frankly.","It\'s a great game, well it has potential to be great, 1. Missions need to be more hands, longer, and have better adjectives. 2. You should be able to buy (or earn) teammates to aid you. 3. It\'s currently boring how easy the enemies are to kill plus there\'s not many of them. 4. Just add some stuff like sas 3 did, well good luck with the game and keep at it.","Pretty awesome. A twin stick shooter with equipment upgrades. It works out of the box with my USB-C controller, and I couldn\'t be happier. It feels like a proper top-down action RPG, bit you can literally pick it up and clear a level with only five minutes to spare. Easy to pick up, have a minute of fun, and quit. Haven\'t even seen a single ad. This is not your usual Android store garbage.","The first time a free game wasn\'t shooting ads in my face every 10 seconds. Gameplay is reminiscent of Alien Swarm. It doesn\'t hold your hand, you might actually have to use your brain to pathfind through a level. The difficulty is fair, all around, looks like the kind of game that\'s worth someone\'s time. Makes me want to actually support the dev.","I enjoy this game. Graphics, game play, items/weapons leveling by experience gained from defeated aliens all well done. Only area I would immediately improve is what I can see while I\'m playing. For example, the camera is close down to the level, which I like especially the destructible environment and details like writing on walls, desks, etc. However, sometimes when moving backwards away from the enemies, shooting at them, they\'ll be off the screen, can\'t see what I\'m aiming at."],"appId":"com.pixelbite.mutant","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pixelbite.mutant&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.noxgames.hex.civ.strategy":{"title":"Hex Polis: Civ Medieval War 4x","description":"Hex Polis is stylizated turn-based strategy game.

Fun Civ-esce feel but also with its own originality. No complaints on ads, as the rewards justify them (which can be quite short at times).

Reminds me of the original Warcraft game style and energy.Great pace of play as well as a balance in upgrading. Please keep up the great work. Any chance of a one time remove all ads option?","I enjoy this game quite a lot, but I have a few critisisms. Unit previews don\'t show how far a unit can see. A unit with 2 sight nullifies the effects of watchtowers. A unit\'s standing animation usually slants to the side, making telling what tiles you can backstab from a bit awkward, if not worse because you can\'t take back movement options you select, meaning you can\'t try a side without commiting to it. Those are my gripes with the game.","Do not get this game. You play through levels so short there\'s barely any point to playing them. Its a naked money grabbing rip off of polytopia. The facing system really sucks, your guys spawn with their back facing the enemy so you get back stabbed straight up. So many things to pay for, its just awful. Don\'t waste your time.","This is a grueling obvious rip off of polytopia accept worse atlease it takes a few minutes to go through a round of polytopia in this I can barely get a few upgrades before my beginner unit bodies the enemy I think a larger scale map would be a huge improvement and tiles that slow but don\'t block units similar to what a game called unciv does"],"appId":"com.noxgames.hex.civ.strategy","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.noxgames.hex.civ.strategy&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.noxgames.mage.hero":{"title":"Mage Legends: Wizard Archer","description":"Roguelike super wizard RPG - Become magical archero and slay monsters in multiple dungeon battles.

There are ads for everything, and eventually the ads cause the app to close itself. Also, your pack prices are ridiculously high and they\'re not even good. No one will be paying $99.99, $199.99, or $399.99 to begin with, but you seriously think the reward of one item and handful of gems will entice anyone? Pure greed. Also, you have to grind so hard to get such little amounts of gold. I have so many scrolls I can\'t use to level my gear because of the tiny reward.","I can\'t wait for the city. I have to say this is a lackluster attempt in the shooter genre. It can\'t even get what it has copied, what every game in this genre slavishly copies, right. There is no progress counter so if you are taken out of the game you must start the chapter completely over. Some rooms repeat, some bosses repeat, even the hint of the day never changes reminding you to stop to shoot. I wanted to experience the unique city bent but I can no longer stand the game enough to do so.","04/30; fixed! 4/29: thank you! Updated 04/28 to say there\'s been 2 updates (at least) since my review and the Desert stage is still broken. Shielded enemies in level 46 don\'t register so you can\'t attack them and now they can\'t attack you, meaning you have to quit and waste what you earned. Fun, but stage 3, level 41-42 is bugged and you can\'t kill the enemies in it, stopping progress. Would like to give it a shot, but needs more equipment and the levels fixed","Better than Archero because equipment allows you to choose what abilities or skills you want to have. However, progress is painfully slow and equipment too hard to come by. The forge is pretty crappy. It only makes stuff I already have our don\'t need. Should be able to choose to try making a weapon or ring at the very least. Keep improving! Lots of promise.","I have been playing a lot of rogue-like shooting lately, and this game has more ad then the other simulator games like this one. I know you\'re trying to make money , but who wants to play a game that every powerups or free gears and have to wait 30 minutes to it. I know the simulator game doesn\'t add more ads then this game. Like the graphics,games play with different lvl powerups, and stage. I don\'t know the game save or if there is a way to save your game. Anyway that\'s my opinion when I play."],"appId":"com.noxgames.mage.hero","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.noxgames.mage.hero&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.gonzossm.sttt":{"title":"Su\u0440er Toss The Turtle","description":"BLAST.CO shop is back in business, and the competition has just risen to a whole new level!

Amazing visuals, easy goals to strive for, small micro transaction that you really don\'t need to help you progress in any way , no constant adds and if there is a add they reward you for watching with in-game currency to unlock more characters. It might be simple minded distance game but it\'s perfect and more mobile developers need to take notes","I love this! The upgraded weapon criteria. The animation redraws that feel just as charmingly nostalgic as the original. The only request I have is to add the option for the original song from the flash game to be an option to turn on. Like a Music Selection Button. The original song made me feel more like a space adventurer and I loved it. For old times sake, Gonzo. Please? Best wishes on every aspect of life, Kyra. (Agent K)","Very fun, has a huge number of creative unlockable characters besides the turtle, everything from a dolphin, a cat, a watermelon, and even a saiyan-like \\"fruitian\\". There are also good power-ups like the UI inspired super instinct. It has ads but they are built into the game in a way that doesn\'t ruin the experience.","You only watch the ads if you want to it\'s not forced. It only gets you skins for the character you play. This used to be an old flash game back in the day so it has nostalgia for me. Same thing and repetitive just make it a little further every time and get up grades not much skill needed but for a free game this has a lot going for it unlike others.","The game is addictive, the gore may not be for everyone but I think it\'s the best part! I keep shattering my highscores when I least expect it and thankfully it\'s not just another pay to win game, and once it starts to pick up you really make some cash and get the next best upgrade. A great way to pass the time, can\'t get the ad for 20 shells to work for some reason but I guess that\'s the best part, there\'s like no ads whatsoever!"],"appId":"com.gonzossm.sttt","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gonzossm.sttt&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.pixio.google.mtd":{"title":"Summoner\'s Greed: Idle TD Hero","description":"You, the greatest and most powerful summoner, broke into the King\u2019s castle and stole his priceless royal treasure!

But after seeing the funny meme-y ads, I gave this game a shot. So far, it\'s been really fun. Everything about this game just seems like smart mobile game design. Instead of playing ads after each wave or whatever, it gives you the choice to get rewards by watching ads. After losing a wave, you can either replay it or start over but you keep your summons\' levels and can relocate them. Kudos to the developer. I\'m impressed.","First of all, The ads for this game are adorable and finally broke me into downloading and playing it. So it\'s an adorable little tower defense that lets you build up over the course of several playthroughs of the waves. Lose on wave 10, start over and move your units that you summon around. Or you can try again with a buff and see if that\'s enough to push through. I\'m enjoying it :)","Pretty fun so far! Edit: with probably more than 20 hours into this game, I have nothing but good things to say. It\'s a fun \\"tower defense\\" game, with ample rewards through your progress. The game can get tough, but you\'re allowed to try again or back up some rounds. The ads are always optional, but do tend to be short and with a nice reward, so I rarely turn one down. 5 \u2b50 / 5 \u2b50 Great Game! Edit: I spent many hours on this game, and now I\'m back. I\'m hoping I\'ll get Monitor\'s rewards!","It\'s a fun game when you have the time to spare, I\'ve always loved tower defense\'s. The cute simple art style is great, in the future once I\'ve played more I hope to see creatures with just a (little) more design details but not a complaint. It\'s fun, thanks for making the ads for the game funny and honest, it did the trick. Lol","I decided to give this a try because the ads for it were pretty funny. All in all, it\'s a nice little tower defense game, but that\'s really about it. I think it would be better if wave progression continued even when you don\'t have the game open, and it notified you when you hit a wall, so to speak. Also, evolution items seem to be cash-only. Never a good idea. Maybe they\'re offered once you clear a certain number of waves, but that goes back to the game not progressing unless you have it open"],"appId":"com.pixio.google.mtd","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pixio.google.mtd&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.Wind.wings.Space.Shooter":{"title":"WindWings: Space Shooter","description":"\u25b6 FANTASY STORY\\n       The game is developed based on a fantasy story about a soldier who accidentally went through a time gap to the future.

A simple space shooter with easy controls and great colors and graphics. Pretty easy to upgrade because coins, rewards and such are in abundance. I love the slow down option because in games like this you just can\'t get outta the way sometimes. It\'s a game you\'ll wanna play all the way through barring any unknown surprise you gotta pay to win. But right now I like it. 5 stars.","Easy to pick up and put down. Paying the $20 for the premium version is well worth it. There are only one reason for not giving this game 5 stars, and that is the Fusion system. In the game, you get item upgrades for your ships, but it is controlled by a random generator, in addition to the ratios being poorly skewed. It makes going for (and therefore, investing in) fusing items relatively pointless. With the exception of that setup, this game is easily one of best time-killers I have played.","Excellent! Graphics are good, the game is fun. Gets tougher as you go, but not so quickly that I just get frustrated because it\'s \\"impossible\\" to win. I might have to restart several times, but not so often that I just quit playing. Actually, it\'s addictive once you start. The one negative is: programmers need to give SOME instruction on upgrading the ships, having multiple ships in play, the drones, and other equipment available for use. I\'ve had to trial and error figure out these things.","Recent update introduced incessant pop up ads that cannot be skipped. The dev response makes no sense. The use of a free game is a deal between the developer and the user. The user watches some ads in exchange for some value: either just the gameplay itself or an in-game item. If you change the amount of ads the user must watch to access the same value in the game, you changed the deal for the worse. I don\'t object to seeing ads. I object to being bombarded with them with no added value.","Best arcade space shooter. All the other\'s don\'t compare. Graphics are great. Game play is pretty fair it\'s good for beginners as well as experts. Multiple ways to upgrade the spaceships. They obviously took there time creating the game, instead of just throwing it together for some fast $$$. If you pay for the premium version you don\'t have to watch any ads. That might be the best part of the whole game. Hat\'s off to the creators good job."],"appId":"com.Wind.wings.Space.Shooter","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Wind.wings.Space.Shooter&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.Gcenter.DefenselegendX.TowerDefense.TD":{"title":"Defense Legend 4: Sci-Fi TD","description":"Being the next part of the series Games Defense Legend, Defense Legend 4 gives Players full of new interesting experiences.

Tower descriptions are often confusing (lightning tower \\"attaches bullets\\" to enemies?) or stupid (\\"slowly gun\\") or look like code. Things that you may like or dislike: hardest difficulty level is still easier than most game\'s normal mode, towers can be destroyed, and you can only put towers in predefined locations","Like it so far. Not the easiest but a good challenge. Have to figure some stuff out on your own because it doesn\'t really tell you much. Biggest complaint is that towers can be damaged/destroyed. You can\'t see all the field at once so you scroll down to place something, scroll back up and you\'ve lost a tower! It would be nice to put towers wherever you want instead of premarked locations also. Other than that, great graphics and fun to play.","Too much over there too graphics where you can\'t even tell what effect your choices are having. If you like being entertained not than engaged, you might like it more than I did. I like a clean game where I can calculate my choices and try out. The graphics in this game is pretty but make it chaotic and you can\'t really keep track of things.","Unfinished game. There are lots of things that simply not completed. 1. The Report Bug doesn\'t have a To email. 2. The menu red dots are inconstant. 3. There are Towers that don\'t have descriptions. Update: I would give it 0 starts. Starting at level 40, you have to complete ALL previous levels at ALL difficulties with PERFECT scores! Really?","How do these broken GD games get such high ratings? Don\'t trust anyone that has to cheat and pad their own ratings. This is so broken its nearly unplayable. By the 2nd level, much of the playing field is off the screen and you can\'t see the battle or place defense in all places. The screen won\'t move or adjust so you just see your defense firing into oblivion but don\'t fully see what\'s going on. It\'s clunky and not smooth mechanics. It\'s not terrible, but it\'s definitely nowhere near 4.9 stars."],"appId":"com.Gcenter.DefenselegendX.TowerDefense.TD","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Gcenter.DefenselegendX.TowerDefense.TD&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.alexanderwinn.landfall":{"title":"TerraGenesis: Landfall","description":"From the makers of TerraGenesis comes TERRAGENESIS: OPERATION LANDFALL - a city building simulator in which you can build, design, and manage your own city in space.

The highest research tiers are a bit too expensive (mid-tier ones are fine). The free placement is nice, but a quick rotation button could help. Could use separate counts for settlers and visitors. Finally, depleted outposts should be dismantled, so the map doesn\'t fill with so many gray markers. The game is still new as of writing, so I hope to see improvements made. Overall, though, good and recommended.","This is an excellent and entertaining take on the original game, featuring many realistic scenarios, costs, and graphics. It truly breaks through the normalcy of city-building games and colonization. They have done a great job balancing both wait times and monetization; ads are completely optional, and for that I sincerely thank the developers. Suggestion-wise, I would love to see higher graphics, and perhaps an option to hide the repair alerts for the sake of visuals. Thank you!","Great game so far! The Mechanics work great and it\'s fun to play. However the frequency of critical events is in my opinion too high. I\'m on the game for 5 minutes during which my batteries broke down, and engineer dies, disgruntled settlers steal a rover? Of all things, makes playing quite difficult, and seems. A little excessive. The zoom settings are sometimes hard to deal with. It would be nice if there was a slider option instead of 2 fixed zoom settings. Hope this helps. Keep it up!","Reduce stars 3 to 2... I\'m stuck! I\'ve finished the tutorial, have 80GP and now I\'m stuck because it is telling me to build a command center.. I already have one! I can\'t move past it. I\'ve tried to click the \\"Settings\\" wheel several times, but it\'s greyed out. All that needs to happen to for the \\"Settings\\" button to be enabled throughout the Tutorial. That way if someone wants to restart, they can.","This game is great, but it does have a few flaws that could be fixed. For example, the whole tutorial was pretty good but if you didn\'t finish it in one go, it would glitch. This would ultimately make it nigh impossible to complete said tutorial, and would require you too Uninstall to reinstall to fix this problem. After you do the tutorial, it is a great game. I love the dynamic of the game and it is not to hard to understand."],"appId":"com.alexanderwinn.landfall","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.alexanderwinn.landfall&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.armorgames.voidtyrant":{"title":"Void Tyrant","description":"Build a deck as you battle across the galaxy, gathering powerful cards along the way.

This game was a solid 4 until the most recent update. Now when I try to watch a video to unlock a prize, get extra currency, or to be revived; it will close the app 4 out of 5 times. The app will completely crash every once in a while. It\'s a shame. I really liked this game.","Found a bug. Repeated tree times. Went for a fourth and discovered there is a variable. I duplicated a card. Second use was free. Then after the round I got both of the cards back in my hand. It completely messed up the interface ui. After it happened the cards were stacking on top of each other in my hand. I got a few screen shots. I used all the cards in my hand and it reset the interface. So I did it again. After the second one I killed my self and went to scene 2-1 and did it again","I really enjoy the game but the random dice roll being tied to your damage is fundamentally flawed. I see what they were going for but at the end of the day it feels terrible to lose because of horrible luck. There is some strategy involved in the ability cards, but most of the time they\'re REQUIRED to win battles and not optional play styles. You could be totally min maxed with your cards and items and still get stomped by a tiny little slime because your luck is bad. Makes it hard to enjoy.","This game has really good combat mechanics between the gauge and the way you can alter it. There are also insane combos and cards(power surge) that feel overpowered but make sense when you need to work for them. The only problem is that often times when you lose a few rounds then you rely on the deck and RNG seems to always favor the AI if I can\'t alter it.","I think the game is very fun and very well made. It\'s simplistic enough to understand quickly but complex enough for strategists. I\'ll admit, I get very frustrated sometimes because I never seem to make it past the second worlds. But that might just be me. It\'s a game that rewards you for learning the mechanics and upgrading. It\'s so satisfying to easily beat an enemy which used to be a problem. I feel like you rely more on confidence than upgrades."],"appId":"com.armorgames.voidtyrant","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.armorgames.voidtyrant&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.gcenter.kingofdefense.battle.frontier.td":{"title":"King Of Defense: Merge TD","description":"King of Defense: Battle Frontier is a special tower defense game.

Sometimes it requires patience, but that makes it easier to integrate into the rest of my life. I wish there was a single button (hit again to confirm) that would put it into pause mode and return to \\"desktop\\" without losing one\'s place in the game. In general, the battles are fun, and finding/achieving upgrades are satisfying, but sometimes frustrating. It has adequately filled the empty times in my life.","The gameplay mechanics are great. Combining tower types is a great ability that sets this game apart from other tower defense apps. I haven\'t felt any need to purchase anything so far in order to win, so that\'s a win. The downside is the grammar; sometimes the English translation is so bungled that you can\'t understand the directions. Doesn\'t make much of a difference on gameplay though, just makes the game feel cheaper.","As I fan of TD games I like this one but it has its issues. Great maps, worlds, towers, levels, heroes, and graphics. However it relies on ads waaaay too much and some levels/enemies are incredibly difficult to beat/kil and the heroes only gain experience if you beat the level (veeery slow progress at times.) Also there are too many options and spending money does not guarantee progress. The heroes to get are Satan, scorch blaze and Brion (I have not unlocked Waylin.) Don\'t get andor or cercle.","I want to see how much money and time the positive reviews spent on the game! One of the most egregious examples of forced pay to win I\'ve ever seen. On level 11 they have a map with an area your champion can\'t reach and there are not enough tower slots to stop the enemy mobs. The solution? Pay $0.99 to unlock a champion trapped in a cage up there.

People were complaining about unfair gameplay so I actually didn\'t spend a penny. (I usually get beginner packs and bonuses early since that\'s when they are most useful.) Yeah, it\'s tough but I went to 11 to see what the fuss was - yes you can cross the chasm with your hero. Just advance slowly. And you get the wolf free once you win that level. You don\'t need to buy it. Okay, so that\'s settled, I\'m buying stuff now.

I think it has potential. First of all, lower the cost of, everything... Make it easier to obtain items, heroes, magic and so on. When you first start playing, you get a nice win streak going on then, you hit a brick wall. Unless you play already completed levels a hundred times over to rack up some crystals, gems, items and etc. Or, of course, you pay to play. Also, when I direct my hero to move, why does he run half way then go back?!","Pay-To-Win: Name of this game is simple. If you want to make it past the first few levels, open your wallet. It is a well put together game with great design and mechanic choices. It\'s too bad it is impossible to get past level 14 without buying your victory. This is a fun way to pass a few hours, but you will quickly delete it unless you\'re willing to buy your way past the very apparent pay-wall.","Starts out pretty fun but the difficulty scales up ridiculously quite quickly as a clear play to push players into microtransactions to progress without extensive grinding of earlier levels to eke out a tiny bit of progress after days or weeks of playing the same missions repeatedly and constantly bombarding you with pop-ups for \\"deals\\" on premium currency, heroes, pets and so on. A good example is that you \\"unlock\\" pirate hero but it really just unlocks the ability to buy him. Trash.","The game is great, I enjoy it, and the ads are not invasive, but there is a very annoying bug... In the tournament supposed to be 100 levels. I got to 25 and the game just stops. If I get out of the mode, then I lose the progress. It is very annoying as I spent a lot of time on it. Also, it is not clear where and how to contact support if there is any.","Good but too many adds. Even the tutorial forces you to view pay only upgrades.

Concepts can be fun but daily rewards are just options to watch more ads. Almost every action brings new adds. Sometimes it displays the button as an ad other times it says claim but is an ad. There is no option to go completely ad free. Just every time you purchase gems you get a few ad free tokens, this is also on top of a monthly subscription that doesn\'t prevent ads. Based on the first 20 minutes of gameplay i had 10 adds, so I\'d say there is an average of 20 per day.","Its a fun game for the most part, alot of ads if you want to do stuff, but hey they have to make money too....only issue is that i think its a dead game, no discord, and no directions on what things do... .like the alter of new heros, has quest to unlock new heros, but after you complete the quest it lets you \\"level up the class\\" but as far as i can tell it does nothing","Great, simple fun, combining standard turn based rpg and idle gaming. Only drawback is you can\'t manage their equipment, there\'s auto-equip, then that\'s it, what they grab is what they have, seemingly forever. Making it virtually impossible to keep the same characters competitive over time as their equipment will simply get outdated and you can\'t upgrade it. Just to make it worse, the auto equip will make some wonky choices.","Love the gameplay. Easy to pickup and learn how combat works. The characters look great and I love how they have different appearances. It might just be a issue with my game, but any time I attempt to load a ad, the game freezes then crashes. The sound is missing from gameplay as well. Overall, a great game but a issue lowers my rating.","So it\'s a good game, but there are some glaring errors: 1) Please change the \\"can\'t fetch ads\\" pop-up! If I\'m connected to the internet and YOU can\'t fetch ads, that\'s your problem not mine so don\'t ask for payment because you failed. 2) Increasing the star-level of items you make should always be done with gold (maybe with a video option if you can\'t afford the gold)! Watching an ad should be a choice, not mandatory.

I don\'t think you should have to put your device into airplane mode just to avoid the amount of ads that get dumped on you. It\'s VERY annoying. After just about every time you die there\'s an ad waiting for you. While I realize ads mean money and as a company money needs to be made, there are ads to double coins, revive, etc. Those are fine. You can purchase something from the shop to get rid of them, but I don\'t have money to drop","When i first installed this game it was super fun. All you have to do to get rid of the ads is turn of your wifi and mobile data but when my zoo started to get bigger and bigger it now has so many bugs to the point where I don\'t enjoy the game anymore. Every time I try to play the Jurassic park it always stays on the loading screen and i always have to restart it. I think if yodo1 would fix these bugs I would and everyone else would enjoy this game much more but that is why I give this 2 stars.","Game is fun most of the time but it\'s overrun with ads, after almost every loading screen there\'s an ad, if you ever play this game I recommend putting it in airplane mode to get rid of the ads. (Note for response: I understand that revenue is needed from ads but it shouldn\'t get to the point where it ruins the experience, I now fear messing up a run because that means I\'ve got to watch an ad afterwards, but I want to make it clear this is a good game)","I have contacted support for multiple big issues. It\'s been days without reply. Playing in the space zoo, once I finish the last of the 3 missions and the run is over,there is no \'done\' button just a blank screen and I have to exit and open the game again, completely losing the ability to upgrade any space zoo enclosure. So the game just acts like the missions never happened and I get 3 new missions but no enclosure upgrade. The game has gotten buggy and makes it hard to binge play like before.","I love this game I really do. I\'ve been pkaying it for a few years now, but it\'s gotten a bit buggier. Of course thats expected with the zoos getting larger, but my biggest problem right now is the ads. To retry you need to watch an ad, but you are unable to close the ad after its finished. So you restart the game, and have to rewatch the ad to play once again. Please fix this! I love the new ocean map but it sucks that I can barely play it."],"appId":"com.yodo1.rodeo.safari","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.yodo1.rodeo.safari&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.sparklingsociety.cityisland5":{"title":"City Island 5 - Building Sim","description":"Build a city, your city\\n\u201cCity Island 5 - Tycoon Building Simulation Offline\u201d, a new city builder game from Sparkling Society, will make you the mayor of small town starting on just one island.

The constant, incessant ads that randomly pop up, that are required for getting any rewards has almost made this game unplayable. The events are now just repetitive and trite. I don\'t see myself playing this game much longer. Enjoyable game to pass the time if you like these kind of sims. A little too easy to click the wrong button and spend coins or keys you\'re trying to save up, but otherwise no major issues.","Follow up from April. Date 8/23/22, Still crashing at random. Just did the update an was hoping it would help. It didn\'t which is disappointing. Still don\'t have the rare decorations. I do like the Catch the crook.. please help! 4/27/22. The game has crashed 6 times in the last 13 minutes. I keep writing reviews & writing to the developers but it is being deleted or removed. This is irritating !! An way too many pop up ads even for a \\"free\\" game. Especially one that you make purchases in","It\'s a really fun game but realistically it takes too long to get to certain levels. For example with the snow level it asked for Community buildings I\'m in level 16 but I have to wait to get to level 34 to get Community Builders realistically that\'s too long and I don\'t know if I\'ll be interested in keep doing it by then. It\'s too hard to earn the dollar gold coins and requires too many coins to achieve things.","Good features and and not so good. It is tough to make a game with the right reward to longevity ratio. This game makes a decent attempt. \ud83e\udd14 The Good -Nice graphics\ud83d\ude01 -Nice concept of multiple islands with different characteristics.\ud83d\ude42 The Bad -No help file (that I could find) to describe the meaning of things. \ud83e\udd14 -Does not automatically collect profits. Forces you to constantly touch screen, for me very annoying. \ud83e\udd28 -Cars driving around forces you to constantly tap screen. Again annoying. \ud83d\ude12","Been enjoying the game for about 3 hours over a day /half making steady progress. One might initially think it\'s a money grab but with a little patience and quest completion there\'s plenty of cash to be made for further advancement. I really appreciate the amount of buildings that can construct and/or upgrade simultaneously. I will have to research what a couple of the road options are for but for now I Think I found a game I\'ll put some spare time in to."],"appId":"com.sparklingsociety.cityisland5","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sparklingsociety.cityisland5&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.dvdfu.chicken2":{"title":"Chiki\'s Chase","description":"Chiki\'s Chase is a high-speed, tricky action platformer.

It\'s cute, pretty, fun, challenging but not too frustrating, and there are no ads! I recommend you buy the full game to support the dev if you can though. The pixel graphics are crisp and colorful, and the sounds and haptics really add to the feel of the game. I like how the shopkeeper dialogue changes with the context. I do wish getting hurt didn\'t make you lose all your stars, and there was an option to flip jumping and attacking.","I love the game, it\'s art and everything about it. It is amazing, I at first thought it would be like most over runner games but I was pleasantly surprised that there were no ads. At all, just a something telling you to buy the ability to collect gems at the end of run, as well as no other in app purchases. Just a single easy one time payment that you don\'t even need to purchase for the full game.","Outstanding side-scrolling game that harkens back to original Mario games. (There is even an element of super mario RPG here.) Gameplay is simple and fun with room for upgrades and ever-changing levels. I wish there was a better \\"checkpoint\\" system as starting all over at the beginning can get mundane. Well done for this programmer\'s first game! I bought the full version as it is worth it.","I would like to preface this by saying I am not one who is easily pleased. But I must say, this game is INCREDIBLE. The soundtrack, the concept, everything. This is one of few games that can always be enjoyed in its original format. There\'s so much to love about Chiki - the character balancing, the simple yet high-ceiling movement capabilites, the sheer number of upgrade combos/strats possible... I could go on and on. And it\'s not super time demanding! Instant classic, 100% worth the download \ud83d\udc4f","I absolutely adore this game. I love all of the small details, this truly is one of the best mobile games I have downloaded in a long time! A few of my favorite things: - EVERYTHING HAS A SOUND!!! You can tell what\'s coming just by the sound it makes! - I LOVE how the lasers add a bass track to the background music! A few suggestions: - It would be really cool if different objects also added tracks, like the lasers. - More statements from the store clerks, maybe? A bit more variety."],"appId":"com.dvdfu.chicken2","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dvdfu.chicken2&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.fluffyfairygames.idleminertycoon":{"title":"Idle Miner Tycoon: Gold & Cash","description":"Are you a true gold miner?

Write us an email: community@idleminertycoon.com","comments":["Unlike a lot of mobile games I\'ve been playing, this game is both not unfinished and there are no forced ads. You\'re going to watch them though to make any progress whatsoever because you\'re darn sure the prices they charge for their silly little digital items, which let me remind you are not real, is absurd. Could easily spend hundreds of USD and have little to show for it. Also $15 USD ad remover. The option to spend money litters the screen at all times. Wallets beware.","It\'s a fun game,, always something to do on it. always save to the cloud before you leave, because if you don\'t and you lose signal for any reason you lose your progress. My 2 biggest problems are the icons on the left that get in the way sometimes, and the fact that some of the mainland mines do not give red gems.","The game is great, and I only have one problem so far... the ads! I know, I know, people say that about so many games & the developers need their money, but I have to put my phone on airplane mode to play. Often times the ads are optional, but you also get random ads. I don\'t like to spend my money on games, so I\'m not going to get the \\"no ads\\" pass thing, so it\'s kind of is my fault that there are ads, but it just ruins the experience when I get a random ad.","I got this game to get diamonds on My Dear Cat thinking I would completely hate it, planning to delete after I get my reward, but I actually enjoyed it. It\'s only 4/5 stars because of the ads. Thats about my only complaint, but y\'all do need to fix that for sure. It would be a much better game. Also the prices for no ads, that isn\'t as much as an issue though as the amount of ads.","It\'s a really fun game and I love the mining and different mines and explorations it is a really nice touch that there are different ones. There are really great offers in the games and the game treats you well! The only tiny problem I have is that it sometimes stops but that\'s just because everything is running at the same time.

I\'ve played nearly everyday for over a year, and I\'ve upgraded my units dramatically. It\'s affected daily quests the most, often making them impossible to achieve. It\'s always the missions that ask you to spend a minimum amount in one game. The amount spent on towers in one game is impossible.","Played this on steam, and loaded my data onto my phone to keep playing. Very fun game! Completely free, at least so far. You can spend money, but it\'s not really required in any way, it\'s more just there so you can support the devs if you choose to. Lots of maps, lots of towers, lots of enemies, really its a bang up job all around! Highly recommended!","Surprisingly deep for just a tower defense game. Having to spend the same single run currency on resource gathering as well as towers to progress makes you think a little more and have to prioritize one over the other. That, along with the insane size of the skill tree leaves a lot to do in the game. Be warned that the game is heavily ad driven when it comes to getting bonuses and such","Very fun tower defense game, with more technical appeal and strategy than superficial graphics-focused games of its genre. If you prefer depth over showy effects, you will love this game. Also, the ads are only for receiving free rewards (which are quite decent), not random popups or requirements to progress from one screen to the next! The developers actually want their players to enjoy the game, not mindlessly click through ads!","Just started playing this afternoon. I\'m hooked, there is so much content to work towards it blows my mind, this would sell great if it had a price tag. The start was a little overwhelming but it\'s a lot easier to figure out the menus and such after the tutorial. Very well designed tower defense game! Looking forward to more content from this development team!!

","comments":["Originally thought this to be a clickbait game but the gameplay is exactly as advertised. It\'s a good way to pass the time and definitely can be addicting. It would be cool if there was an option to make it more challenging. I paid for the ad free version years ago and the app remembered it when I re-downloaded it now. It can be played offline but to really get some of the cool stuff, you\'ll have to watch ads. Overall I\'d say 4.5\u2b50\ufe0f","LOVE the game. I would have rated 5 stars, however, I am on Level 1,572 and the levels are so repetivitive. Also, what is killing me is that I have been on the same level for 3 weeks now because the game keeps crashing. I love the game, and don\'t even mind the ads, so I have been patiently waiting for this issue to be resolved, but I\'m about to just delete it. I used to play off and on every day. Now I may TRY to play once every few days but still crashes4 seconds in... PLEASE fix this.","Overall a good game. It can get a little bit of challenging with some of the later levels. It does contain ads about every other two runs. Sometimes free stuff would come but it would be in and cost of an ad. There was a moment where I said no thanks to watching an ad, but it still played an ad. I am not much of an ad person. But overall, a fun game to get into.","Cool concept and fun to play for the first 30 minutes or so. Annoying to have to wait to get the gun shop and find nothing of use over and over again. I stuck it out and finally bought the $10,000 machine gun only to find that the $1,000 one that I bought near the beginning was way better. Very repetitive with no payoff after about the first 25 levels. It\'s literally the same thing over and over with new outfits. The guns don\'t get any better and every level is super easy.","Enjoyed the first thirty or so levels. Seemed like a decent idea, short obstacles with bullet time. Paid the $2.99 to remove ads because of how many ads there were and I had been enjoying the game. After about an hour I noticed most of the levels were recycled. The difficulty does not go up and there are maybe 40 different layouts of levels. Lack of variety make this game boring. $2.99 isnt bad for like an hour of entertainment. But thats all this game is worth.

The visuals are very nice. Plenty to do from mission completion, to battles, decorating and etc. Game lags here and there but not too much. My issue are the crashes. The game crashes every time I play. Sometimes as soon as it loads into the game it\'ll crash. It\'s crashed 5 times back to back as soon as it loaded, on the 6th try I finally got to play. This game is really nice, and I don\'t plan to stop because of the crashing. It\'s just annoying, but hopefully can be fixed!","The game is really cool and fun to play. However it crashes way to much, mostly when in battles. Once you get to higher level and unlock more park expansion(which should cost coins) it doesn\'t work and makes you use the cash(dollars). Please fix the game. Its great! Would give 5 stars if it didn\'t crash so much.","Love game but getting frustrated. Now can only use dino cash to buy land expansion. It gets where only way to finish task you have spend a lot of money. I have bought passes and etc. But I can\'t always. I have lost battles from glitches . No other games I play does this. So it not my connection. Try reaching out for support and no response of yet. My screen is sometimes blacked out and land expansion shows no cost . If I am able to get it ,I need 200 in dino bucks. Please fix the bugs in game!!!","Constant crashes sometimes at random but they typically occur upon trying to load the game are after watching an ad, also unrelated but I don\'t like how theve locked everything behind \\"special events\\" or pay walls, you used to be able to get most dinosaurs via progression in the battle arena but that doesn\'t seem to be the case anymore. Either way though that\'s been my experience with this game","Here are a few changes I would like to see. The ability to rotate buildings for better placement. Once a dinosaur is level 40, I would the option to choose which evolution the dinosaur will appear as (for aesthetic purposes). Having a friends list on the game and being able to battle my friends in real time would be awesome. A chat option would also be great! Lastly $100+ dollars for a pack is outrageous. For that kind of money, the dinosaurs should drop at level 40 with no hatch time."],"appId":"com.ludia.jurassicworld","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ludia.jurassicworld&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.noodlecake.altosodyssey":{"title":"Alto\'s Odyssey","description":"Just beyond the horizon sits a majestic desert, vast and unexplored. \\n\\nJoin Alto and his friends and set off on an endless sandboarding journey to discover its secrets.\\n\\nSoar above windswept dunes, traverse thrilling canyons, and explore long-hidden temples in a fantastical place far from home.\\n\\nAlong the way, you\u2019ll grind across vines, bounce atop hot air balloons, ride towering rock walls, and escape mischievous lemurs \u2013 all while uncovering the desert\u2019s many mysteries. \\n\\nFeatures:\\n\\n\u2022 A standalone experience.

It\'s simple to learn, but compelling. Great, art. And for awhile, it actually was fun. But... The ad model is awful. An 30 second ad every time you die if you want to continue your progress. But the game play is what really cuts it for me. Game physics change randomly so what worked before might not work the next time. Lighting changes to where you can\'t see your player. Quests that depend on unreachable goals. Ruins the game","O: There is a loud, obnoxious ad after nearly each round. Also, opting to watch an ad to revive Alto will close the game, causing it to restart the round instead of picking up where he landed. It is very irritating. I downloaded the app yesterday. I have only played a couple times, and it seems like fun. The effects of the ads are annoying, though. UD: Paid to remove ads. Now it glitches, moving the character in a way that causes crashes. Glitches also shake the scene causing round loss.","Sort of fun, controls are simple, and not much explanation is given. Would be a soft 5 stars BUT when I choose not to watch a 30-second unskipable ad to revive, I\'m still hit with watching a 30-second unskipable ad just to start over. Not a huge issue except I keep getting long flat sections (can\'t do tricks) followed by chasms that require a lot of speed to cross (you see why the ad issue is frustrating now, right?). Uninstalling, may try again in a year.","It\'s a very relaxing game, just as the last one was. The soundtrack is very immersive if you put in earbuds, like the sound of sledding on the sand and the grinding on the vines and the music is wonderful and pleasant even after an hours worth of play, the storm and waterfalls are just amazing. And not to mention the detailed landscapes\u2764\ufe0f The only slight problem is that it\'s more sensitive than the last game and the ads are a bit more frequent.","It\'s fun and zen and easy to lose hours to. The problem for me is the ads. The game\'s main draw is a sort of zen flow state, and these ads blasting in your ear completely take you out of it. Also, when you die, it\'ll offer you an ad to revive. If you turn down the ad, sometimes it\'ll play anyway and give you nothing. I don\'t know what the alternative is, since all things must be monetized, but it\'s yet another case where capitalism has robbed a game of the thing that makes it compelling."],"appId":"com.noodlecake.altosodyssey","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.noodlecake.altosodyssey&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.erow.stickmanheroes":{"title":"One Gun: Stickman","description":"This game is the greatest RPG action game, is combination of fighting games and shooting games.

However it literally takes too long move in to the higher levels. You have to watch videos to get big amounts of coins and even then you beat like 1 or 2 levels before having to watch another like 10 videos just to maybe get to the next level. This game relies on watching ads to level up because without them it would take forever to get the amount of coin needed","I really like this game, but I remember a time when it was harder to get items, when there were no ads to watch to get coins, I just came back to this game and I\'m sad to see it become so easy. If I would recommend something, I would recommend to make it harder to get coins and rare items, maybe set a limit on the amount of ads someone can watch to get money, also add more weapons that cause knockback, it\'s super fun to win by never getting touched, I only think one weapon causes knockback.","I think its a gery good way to pass time and play for fun. I find it super fun because of all the different ways to upgrade like equipment and skills. One thing i find annoying is that super gun pop up. It looks like a bow. Its not the constant pop up that is annoying its that the pop up stops the music and interrupts my groove. If you could make it not interrupt my groove I would be appreciative. Thx great game.","Could be a fun game.. If it wasn\'t riddled with ads. Got to the minigun, only for it to just.. stop firing every few seconds. Im holding the attack button, nothing happens. Game now crashes VERY frequently, the menus are confusing as hell for new players, and the difficulty is so weirdly scaled with no hints as how to unlock certain abilities.","Would be five stars but after buying the 10 elite chests with the minigun at level 50 my game crashed(for the first time yet) and I lost all the items. There doesn\'t seem to be a restore purchases option either. Also, the \\"no ads\\" purchase with different characters doesn\'t cancel the rewards ads which is extremely frustrating considering how many it takes to unlock chests. The small boxes should be at most one ad to unlock. It makes the game nearly impossible to progress in"],"appId":"com.erow.stickmanheroes","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.erow.stickmanheroes&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.ketchapp.rider":{"title":"Rider","description":"Get ready for some flippin\' action!\\n\\n\\n\\nPerform insane stunts while you cruise through the never-ending world of Rider!

I really enjoy it. Good selection of bikes and a good thing to play when you have nothing to do. However, the random bike feature is not good at all, due to the fact that it chooses like 5 bikes and doesn\'t actually cycle through your entire garage. There are a few bugs as well and some obstacles that aren\'t possible, but still a fun game. Edit: I decided to add the fact that sometimes it flips you for no reason, and that can be frustrating. Also the music can be a bit repatative.","It was fun until it started flipping with my interaction. The game decides to flip on it\'s own, a lot of the platforms are set just far enough off that it will bounce you off course. I understand that it may need to limit your speed but just intentionally ruin the game? Why? \\"You\'ll get more cars cause they effect your game.\\" Which is true. The vehicle you drive can heavily affect your game.","I thought it was an amazing flawless game at first but I keep bouncing off of things that shouldn\'t be bounced on or going to fast and not being able to control the car while crashing into the next obstacle, and somthing when i use an ad it sends me back to the home screen? I know how hard it was to create this game but mabye there should be some sort of brake thing? Sometimes you shouldnt fix whats not broken and its a really good game other then the very small glitches!","Really fun, but sometimes I\'ll watch an ad to get revived and be sent back to the title screen anyway, or spawned off a cliff and die immediately. The game is far too inconsistent and glitchy to be considered great, physics don\'t work consistently and the random nature of the obstacles means sometimes you\'ll be going too fast to survive the next one, or too slow to make a jump, but you won\'t know until it\'s too late. Good way to kill time unless you have rage issues like I do.","I found it quite intertaining, there isn\'t to many adds either. The game has simple controls that are easy to learn aswell. I wish the transition from easy to hard was a little better though. There is a few glitches, like I can be on the ground and be holding down the button to move forward but randomly flip and die. Sometimes it\'s laggy near the start if not great internet. Over all, I suggest you play the game when your waiting or have a short amount of free time before your busy again."],"appId":"com.ketchapp.rider","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ketchapp.rider&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.maddog.shaqfu":{"title":"ShaqFu: A Legend Reborn","description":"The world lies on the brink of disaster.

The ads don\'t bother me, but there\'s not a lot to do besides wait then scroll up and down your floors and click on the doors/super zombies. Currency takes a while to accumulate and it does not gather offline, so really the experience of this game is leaving your phone running it and doing something else.","This game is not bad. But do the ads roll in. It is set up to make you want to watch ads for premium currency (only way to upgrade your bonuses). Then you get an ad almost everytime you open a chest, fight a zombie boss on a floor, or open a door to rescue someone. I would have stayed if it wasnt for the ads constantly popping up every time I played the game","It isnt worth it friends. There is no \\"no ad\\" package so even when you put money into it you still get ads. The game is super slow with very little replayability. It has no normal incremental growth. Instead it is very much a \\"pay to play\\" and \\"pay to advance\\". Sure you could go at it free but you\'ll be stuck there for weeks with little to no advancement.","This is a good game for when I\'m taking a breather from life. The one thing that bugs me is the ads, there\'s an ad after every 3 zombies, there\'s an ad when changing menus, there\'s even the occasional idle ad when I\'m not even doing anything. In short when I\'m playing seriously, I shouldn\'t have to see 7 ads in the span of a single minute","Fun and easy overall, but the jump of in game currency for upgrades is pretty high. You go from paying 100 coins to 100,000.and getting that doesn\'t come easy. But, an easy to get into game with pretty good potential. I\'d like to see more characters or specialists and maybe be able to place them on certain levels, and an easier way to grind in game currency or a more steady increase in price."],"appId":"com.spcomes.zombiehive","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.spcomes.zombiehive&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.foursakenmedia.blockfortressempires":{"title":"Block Fortress: Empires","description":"Welcome to the Blockverse - a mysterious and dangerous universe made out of cubes.

However, there are a few things that I think could be fixed. For example, in my opinion, this game is only playable if you turn the look sensitivity and attack look sensitivity all the way down, and play in first person. Most of the guns are extremely difficult to aim if not played with these specifications, which could possibly be fixed by making the crosshair bigger. Other than that, it is a mostly perfect game.","I would give more stars is i knew how exactly to change my defense station from the default. I spent a lot of time on the second defense systems and want to change over to that one instead of default. But i can\'t seem to figure it out as there is no options to do so from what i have seen so far. Could i het some assistance in this? The game is awesome so far besides this seemingly annoying glitch.","It is quite an interesting game, and although the melt guns are rather overpowered, this game is pretty good! I think previously my suggestion was a bit nonsensical, but I just recently cooked up an idea that would help most of the playerbase. If instead of just getting what you get with an upgrade, you can choose what and how much you to upgrade that, using a point spending system.","It\'s awesome! I do experience some glitches and bugs sometimes(such as the holo turret, when set on the side of something, glitches out and often floats.) Other than that, it\'s all good! Keep up the good work! Oh and if it were possible, I\'d love more customizations such as... wings/capes, new heads, armor/body and all that. Looking unique is good! ^^","Awesome game, for sure, but I have a few frustrating issues. For one, look controls become janky during raids, making aiming more difficult. Second, and this is a big one for me, there is no Undo Last function when building. We need that, because my third issue is the inconsistent move/look controls during building. Often, the sides of the screen will swap, or the input will fail and I will bore a 10-tile hole into the floor I cannot fill without consuming build points.

I bought this game when I was 10 years old and I had a lot of fun with it (4 years ago) I see a lot of people talking about difficulty and stuff but I\'m pretty sure you can change difficulty, and I never had a problem with it even when playing on normal, some levels will be hard because it\'s a strategy game not casual. (Also probably just a skill issue) Really nice storyline and great gameplay! Never bought anything except a hero either so it\'s not that hard.","Perfect Mobile Strategy Game! What a gem to find a strategy game that works well with mobile, offers decent paid upgrades buy isn\'t pay to win (the upgrades are just new captains), and a challenging series of maps as well as a TON of achievements. I just finished all the achievements and I absolutely love all easter eggs and how much was put into the game. I hope for more like it in the future. My only criticism is some of the paid captains aren\'t very good. Blue Dragon is great though!!","Fantastic game design, however the difficulty curve is insane. A little too insane for my taste sadly. You end up being dependant on purchasing bombardments from the store to be able to get anywhere by the 3rd mission, but you never have enough because you have to use them so often just so you dont get overwhelmed. Not a game for casual players, and not worth the money i spent.","I really like how you can upgrade the heros and have a tech tree, I like that there are two different currency\'s in the game, I think it adds some challenge, especially if you don\'t use your coin abilitys wisely, it adds some planing to it instead of using them all over, and the bosses are challenging but beatable if you look at the patterens, overall a very good game. ( I don\'t get all the people saying they can\'t beat the bosses, I take them out quite quickly, then again I play alot)","Stuck on one of the very early levels. Difficulty sky rocketed so fast, I\'m guessing this is where they expect us to buy something. ------ Reply to developer ----- Too late, game has already been uninstalled. Maybe I\'ll try it again in a year or two and see if you made any changes. It\'s pretty clear based on other replies as well that this level is insanely difficult compared to the first few so maybe it\'s you\' that needs to go back and evaluate how you\'re building these levels out."],"appId":"com.ironhidegames.android.ironmarines","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ironhidegames.android.ironmarines&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.asanteegames.magicrampage":{"title":"Magic Rampage","description":"Exciting platformer that combines the RPG genre with fast-paced action gameplay.

With an ipega 9167 connected, the character will move constantly and the gamepad can only change the direction of movement, the character never stops running. No option in gamepad options to configure between joystick or d-pad for movement. Update: made screencapture report to devs, got back a cookie cutter \\"We will definitely keep an eye on this.\\" which actually means \\"we know and don\'t care.\\" so im subtracting a star.","Awesome game. If you like old-school games, then this is one of the best ones. My complaints: the first one is fire suit doesnt exactly protect you from fire attacks, the prices of items go up disproportionately and down at random moments. The items are sometimes just randomly taken out from the store. 2 stars for the ridiculously high prices and taking items out of store. Also, Some ads are mature in nature.","Overall, this game has a lot of potential. Unfortunately, the buttons often have a delayed response (specifically the jump button). It can make it extremely annoying when trying to double jump across a big gap, to get treasures or search for secret areas. Also, there should be a way to configure the button setup. To move them, reorder them, or change their size. If there is a way to do so, I\'ve yet to find it. Other than these 2 things, it\'s a great game.","I very much enjoy this game. Really old school vibe, easy controls, and secret areas to find, reminds me of the good days. The amount of gold you earn vs the costs of stuff is pretty fair, and lots of weapons, gear, and uses for each of them specifically. All in all, nothing negative to say about it! Perhaps being able to customize your character a little more than just the eye/skin color would be cool, just saying lol.","The game is actually really fun. Grinding for loot and gold isn\'t all that bad, plus it gives plenty of incentive to go back to previous levels anyway. The loot is good, it\'s fast-paced, action packed and pretty challenging. I do wish there was inventory management... I know it kind of does it automatically, but not in the order I want it. I also noticed how much easier the enemies died when I payed real money... I got a sword so good it practically forced me to change classes."],"appId":"com.asanteegames.magicrampage","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.asanteegames.magicrampage&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.lemonjamgames.neonimpact":{"title":"Neon Impact","description":"Clicker Endless RPG.

The every day sign in is broken, Ive been getting the 8th day prize (an SSR) every day for 2 weeks.","improved everything over Infinite Knights, except gameplay. Like S&P2, adding things doesn\'t make it \\"better\\". Full of busy work and making no progress for it. Income based off of resets and not combat str, and you can\'t farm resets because cooldowns. Can\'t even farm for currency because they\'re locked behind quests that become uncompletable when airships are exhausted, or a dungeon every 10 minutes ONLINE. Gear system even @#$% than IK. Only good thing is everything accessible on 1 scrn.","The game fantastic, i dont like games like that but your game was so good but you have problem, when the game give you new things like dungeon battle or something like that, the level you unlucked in characters and all coins bot will luck, can you fix this problem and also can you make the game with google game app and add some Achievements","Ad buttons aren\'t clearly marked.

The party that is the main part of the game moust often it\'s even visible as you are busy in some kind of menu.","At first I was hesitant to play this since it was like a rip-off of Honkai but with a different kind of gameplay and it turns out the game is pretty fun even though it\'s a little rip-off.

This game, not so much. You have to discard 4 of your towers every time. Desert maps cause overheat, bosses change spawn points at random, your towers always getting stunned. For me these new additions just made the game much more *infuriating*, not more fun. And there\'s not very many maps either. Wool/unlocks were fine. This game is ok, but I would pay money to get the original on Android.","Top tier tower defense game I hate spending money on games. I chose to spend a few bucks to support the developers on this one. Minimal ads. Grinding is minimal. Basically, it lacks the kind of baloney that we have all come to accept as normal for phone games. The game has a unique visual aesthetic. The towers and enemies are carried in a way that requires some strategy. The maps and worlds are varied. Ice, desert, forest. Also a mix of maps that are open or have pre set paths","Pretty decent TD game. You\'re trying to defend against aliens that are trying to kidnap the most intelligent life on Earth (sheep). So far, I have three issues with gameplay. 1) Tesla towers are supposed to attack air and ground units, but seem to only attack ground. 2) in Hard mode there is no way to earn 3 stars. a perfect game will yield 4 stars, but losing one sheep will cost your score two stars. 3) I try to get a perfect score on every map, and I am at a point in the second set of maps where I cannot get a perfect score in Hard mode, so that irks me. But, overall good game.","Can\'t play, sent crash data reports. I use a Samsung galaxy s20 and when I open the app it allows me to login with my Google play. Afterward, I select the button to start but once I select the first stage it turns off. When I close and re open the app it asks me to send crash data, which I obliged. Graphics look decent. Would love to be able to change the rating so if whatever is causing this gets patched and I\'m alerted, ill give it another try.","Just a really fun Tower Defense game... With no ads! No in-your-face micro transactions! Some of the level designs (like the desert levels) can be so challenging, in a good way, that makes you keep coming back. In my opinion, this game is up there with BloonsTD6.

So much of it was garbage, and this, while not the best quality, was very fun. Still fun today. I don\'t mind giving $6 to the creators 10 years later (don\'t actually remember how long it\'s been) after playing it for free for many hours after school. I only wish it were more difficult. They very easy strategy is to let them build up a line of units, march up to your base, and spam range. That way, all of your range (all 10ish) are firing at the same time. Doing massive damage. Good 2 hour time waster to do the campaigns. Music is great","I love the game it is something I used to play a lot however there are a couple of things that are wrong with this. First the A.I is extremely unballanced. It basically has infinite resources turned on and gets really op if u look away from the game for more than 5 seconds. 2 (this one isn\'t that bad but) the 30 second unskipable adds are a bit of a let down and I understand that the games can go on for a very long time so after each one there is an add that is ok but to not be able to skip. No","Nice and fun time killer. Overall great, but gets repetitive pretty quickly. The game does give you options but most of them you have to pay for. Also it doesn\'t feel like any previous games make any progress in the next. Like playing the same thing over and over again without any bonuses from previous victories. Beside that, everything is great. Like the design, artstyle, the general ideas of the characters and the idea of the generation shifting, Overall great game.","Not a game you keep, but definitely worth playing, for a few hours. Can be played offline, gives a lot of Google Play Achievements XP, tough only 2 of the said \'Commanders\' is free. If you\'ve never played the flash game (like me), the trick is to play defensively, until you reach the super unit, in the last age. Stay within your Towers range, don\'t unlock 4th units (to save Gold) and don\'t worry if your opponent has advanced to the next age. \'Hard\' is beatable with this simple strategy.","I really like this game. However when I played the different difficulties I found that medium was too easy and hard is still hard so there\'s no medium really, and the ai isn\'t smarter, just more op. When I also decided to buy the general mode it wouldn\'t work, so I uninstalled and installed it a few times (worked the 4th time) and it unlocked general mode but when I pressed on it, it told me to buy general mode again which is annoying. Overall this game is great just don\'t buy anything."],"appId":"com.maxgames.aow2","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.maxgames.aow2&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.noxgames.hitman.hero.arpg":{"title":"Agent Hero: Action Hitmaster","description":"There is no end to the action in this fast-paced archer like shooter RPG that pulls you straight into a world of non-stop shooting and dodging.

Great 3D animation and designs all around. Really fits the atmosphere they are trying to show from the games identity. The requirements are a bit high though. This in turn bring a few glitches to the game. Such as a double screen after loading from the cafe. As well as, freezing on some story progression. Please fix this if possible.","This is a 5 star game. BUT my issue is that you guys make some things unnecessarily difficult even with tutorials available to assist the player. While I did figure it out on my own, you need to make going to places such as 1-10 to 1-11 more obvious. That yellow \\"Q\\" doesn\'t really stick out well. While the game itself should be challenging, it should not be challenging to figure out how to progress yourself in the game. Please make it easier to figure out where you need to go on the map.","I really like this game and how it plays. I wish I could rate it higher but there are so many bugs. Even since I started playing chapter 3 everything stops working at completely random times. Sometimes I can play for hours without problems. But it\'s gotten to the point that I can no longer enjoy the game due to it not being playable. Please fix these bugs. You have a really good game here. I want to give you guys a much better review.","I\'m really enjoying the game and characters, but this game seems to be overheating my phone. I\'m playing on a OnePlus 7pro and as soon as I play for a few minutes my phone gets dangerously hot. Not sure if it\'s the game or my phone, but it doesn\'t seem to overheat when playing other games. Hopefully this gets sorted out.","After playing for a few days I\'ve a better feel for this game. It\'s pretty fun but I docked another start for two reasons. First is that when your adventure you have to pay attention and click on background elements to get rewards. Second is the stupid recruitment system that requires 100% attendance for a month to get the chosen hero. I despise that mechanic and it\'s likely why I\'ll end up dropping this."],"appId":"com.ftt.eroica.gl.aos","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ftt.eroica.gl.aos&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.boltrend.disgaea.en":{"title":"DISGAEA RPG","description":"DISGAEA brought to mobile!\\n\\nThe Netherworld, a place deeper than the deepest ocean and darker than the darkest cave.

I\'ve had crashes before but now it\'s just ridiculous especially with the last 2 updates. I can\'t even load it up. It just turns off in the black loading page. It might start up once every 10 tries, which sometimes that doesn\'t work. Once I get it started by luck, it crashes and shuts down again soon after when I go to change the page or something. Absolutely impossible to play anymore.","Unable to even open the game as it crashes immediately had this problem for about a week now and from what I\'ve seen this has been a problem for a long time. I\'ve spent hundreds of dollars in this game and am well built in it, I can\'t grind or even use my stamina this needs to be fixed immediately :Edit- I dropped this game as it was never fixed constantly crashes making it unplayable and here I am again and the game is STILL unplayable! This is just ridiculous! It\'s like the devs don\'t care!","Decent game, play on steam though. Andorid version keeps crashing as of the latest update there needs to be a patch that fixes this as I can\'t even get past the title screen. This is a problem for many players on mobile. The steam version is more stable so use that one instead if you want to play. Buying gems are expsenive. F2p is possible this game if you grind for it. Gameplay is fun, spritework and art is great and the animations are quality. Bugs need to be fixed though as rn its unplayable","Edit: I really like this game, I wish there was a proper Disgaea game with a comparable roster, but every update is a nightmare trying to find enough space. Some of the new features are neat, but I feel like the point of a mobile game is missed and too much data is dedicated to one of several pass schemes trying to get blood from a stone. Even though I like it better than one game I have on my phone, I had to drop this one because that\'s just kicking the can down the road with the space problem.","I want to point out that this is NOT a tactics RPG like the mainline Disgaea games, it\'s an auto battler. However, everything else is on point! I waited on this one for a while, because - and I don\'t mean this in a hurtful way - a LOT of Boltrend\'s games, particularly their licensed titles, have quality problems. Translation errors still pop up in places but the main story so far has been consistent, and it\'s been very easy to get up to speed with all the first time player extras I\'ve gotten."],"appId":"com.boltrend.disgaea.en","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.boltrend.disgaea.en&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.notdoppler.earntodie2":{"title":"Earn to Die 2","description":"Drive your car through a zombie apocalypse in this massive follow-up to the chart-topping hit Earn to Die!\\n\\nAn evacuation ship is waiting on the other side of the country.

An ad would pop up after 3-4 runs, no biggie. But now it\'s after every run, and these ads have 3 screens to close most of the time. It\'s nuts, and the game is SO good. I played through it years ago before this insane ad culture whatever appeared. Such a bummer...","This game is awesome. I just beat it at just under 500 days. I like that the game is beatable without having to pay for things. I watched a ton of ads though for extra money. The amount of forced ads to playing is amazingly balanced. The only thing I do not like is that every cars strength and power is the same. I think that when the cars get bigger and more powerful the obstacles should become bigger and stronger. My tiny starter car should not blast through the same as the giant dump truck.","loads of fun! Game isnt so easy or dull that I delefed it after one day, but also not too difficult that it gets frustrating. The action and graphics are fun and exciting. Like all free games, there are commercials after each course, but the courses are long enough that you dont feel like you spend more time on ads than you do on the actual game. two thumbs up!","This has to be the most replayable game i\'ve installed (& reinstalled). i played 1 & 2 in highschool 8 years ago and still occasionally play. The controls are accurate. Each time you go back in you can go through a different route, and can always improve your distance, with good strategy. This game always keeps me entertained and i would rate 6 stars if possible. And if i could beg the devs to make a third, i\'d do it 100 times. Highly recommend!","Games sorta fun. It gets a bit boring. After every 3 stopping points, you get a new car. Can\'t use the previous one so you\'re stuck with a slow, unupgraded car yet again. It\'s pretty much rinse and repeat. If you don\'t feel like playing, you get much more money watching adds than you would actually playing so if you want to get through the boring parts, do that."],"appId":"com.notdoppler.earntodie2","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.notdoppler.earntodie2&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.babeltimeus.legendstd":{"title":"Realm Defense: Hero Legends TD","description":"Defenders!

Journey alongside Beastmaster Hogan and the Goddesses deep into the sewers of Elysium to unlock the Rebellion Leader Osan and his poisonous frog buddy Broto!","comments":["Came back after awhile. Levels become harder as progress. But still fun since this allows play offline, great option when there\'s no wifi available. And they have more worlds and levels too now. Too many complain need buy gems but so far have been doing just fine playing it free. They give you enough gems to save up for heroes (just depends which you choose). This app is frustrating that it occasionally crashes before it launches. So just beware and save progress.","I\'ve been playing at a steady pace for months. Very fun and enjoyable, lots of things to expand to keep the game fun. A tad slower than I\'d perfer, and sometimes you need certain characters to get through levels, or it will be very difficult. That\'s the worst feature, as these characters cost a lot of in game currency that I\'d rather spend elsewhere. All in all though, about as solid a tower defense game you could ask for, I\'d try it out if I were you! :)","This game is a lot of fun. Engaging mechanics and fun heroes. However, the cost of advancement is very steep. The cash prices for heroes and resources are very high, and the rate of gain for crystals is WAY too slow. The recently added achievements are broken for experienced players. Many of them cannot be completed without starting a new account. Please fix this issue!","As the game continued to add features (which is great), it consistently locked many of said features behind pay walls (which is awful). Moreover, it began to make even basic functions (such as progression, leveling, etc.) pay-walled, unless you don\'t playing for 5 minutes daily for months just to accumulate what you would need. Sad, as I played this game when it was first released and it had so much potential, to the point where I wouldn\'t mind investing. Now, it\'s simply too expensive.","Fun tower-defense game. Not pay-to-win. Customer service is slow but good. The game definitely gets more challenging as I go along, which is great. It seems a bit overly complicated. For example, each of your heroes has a level and a rank and abilities and \\"awakenings\\" to level up. I guess that\'s for people who play for months and need a little more to do."],"appId":"com.babeltimeus.legendstd","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.babeltimeus.legendstd&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.loadcomplete.mergedefense":{"title":"Merge Tactics: Kingdom Defense","description":"Merge Tactics is a unique defense game filled with elements of growth, strategy, and challenge.\\nIt lets you place blocks wherever you want, based on whatever fighting strategy you use.\\n\\nGame Features\\nCreate Your Own Battle Decks and Strategies\\n- You need different decks and strategies to effectively deal with the various invaders that attack your forces. \\n- Every time you clear a wave, you\'ll get to expand your territory on the battlefield and employ even more diverse defense strategies.\\nMerge Blocks into More Powerful Units\\n- In this game, one can be stronger than two\u2014even three!

I don\'t know. I guess it didn\'t look very appealing, at first... It\'s actually rather addictive. Requires good strategy to stop the onslaught of enemy barreling down on you, and the ability to change it on the fly. Play is technically turn based, but not slow paced, as you might think it would be. F2p is totally possible, but I personally won\'t have an issue spending a few dollars on a game that absolutely deserves it, like this one. Thanks, devs!","I\'ve played a few different games like this one. And it\'s basically a strategic matching tower defense. You can only merge the same units. And they must have the same level. And your only goal is to defeat the waves of enemies before they get to your commander. The ability to play offline is a nice addition, and it\'s a simple game with advanced quick thinking to outmaneuver the tetris like waves. I\'d recommend it to any tower defense, and/or tetris fans.","The gameplay is simple and intuitive, your strategies must evolve as you progress through the game. The upgrade system is well developed and metered. Resources are scarce enough you can\'t max everything too quickly but plentiful enough you dont have to grind. It\'s a fun, exciting, & challenging game! The graphics are great stylistically for the type of game it is. All in all it\'s a 10/10, keep up the great work guys, I look forward to your future releases and Ill download them all!","Solid foundation for great game. It\'s engaging both in its gameplay and art design, but also has depth of strategy and a potential for very strong late game. 5 stars to help support it and hope to see some improvements. Please improve UI. Add option to filter/sort/more easily compare blocks and teams. Please add option for more team slots, I\'d even be okay paying. More game modes, or progress tracks. Just need more ways to play and more data. Good game as is, room to be better.","Fun, cute game with simple mechanics. Very generous with rewards and has optional ads that don\'t get in your way, which is great, in my book. There\'s also NO ENERGY/STAMINA keeping you from playing the game (except for the Challenge mode, and Endless mode can be replayed by watching an ad). My one criticism is that I\'d like to see a game mode that does something different from the others. Something to break the formula. Otherwise this is a fun mobile game that I\'d recommend!"],"appId":"com.loadcomplete.mergedefense","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.loadcomplete.mergedefense&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.windforce.wjxt.fanti":{"title":"Infinite Cultivation","description":"Infinite Cultivation is based on genres of eastern fantasy literature (wuxia/xantian), an \'idle\', tick-based MUD(multi-user dungeon; the precursor to the MMORPG) that returns to the core of MMORPGs.\\n\\nThis is a huge world of immortal cultivation.

So if u feel like it doesn\'t have enough games to fight.....u haven\'t leveled up enough \ud83d\ude43 \ud83d\ude42","Very fun game, though it might have p2w features competing as a f2p player while might be hard and require quite a lot of determination it\'s still in an acceptable area. The overall aspect of the game is pretty simple and honestly I like it better than IT right now! Plus the game has ample options at the beginning to get you jump started if you\'re a bit late in joining a server. Overall I recommend if you\'re casual or not.","The game is a fun way to pass the time, the chat function in game is a little buggy, but from what I understand it\'s because of the auto translate feature. Some of the words get covered by other images would if fixed would be helpful. I would rate this higher, but the game crashed when I made a purchase and took the payment but didn\'t give me my items, I reached out to the in game support, it took a bit but the issue was taken care of.","The game is decent, in many ways it feels like a modded version of IT. It definitely feels more user friendly with a bunch of minor nitpicks from IT fixed or improved. There\'s still plenty of translation problems but it\'s playable and they seem open to suggestions. Major problem for me is that when I try buying bundles etc it brings up a screen for jade of the same price and charges me but I don\'t receive anything and character limits seem very small in text boxes making contacting support hard.","Overall it\'s a decent, relaxing tap gaming experience. If you want to level up quickly you do have to sink money into it, but it\'s optional and can go for the lengthier grind Issue I would have is the games aspect ratio, my text runs off the screen so I can\'t see requirements for the next sect level up 5-6"],"appId":"com.windforce.wjxt.fanti","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.windforce.wjxt.fanti&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.hidea.cat":{"title":"Cats & Soup - Cute idle Game","description":"\u2665Us cute catz hav arrived hooman!\u2665\\n<2021 Google Play Indie Games Festival TOP3 Selected Game>\\n\\nLooking for a cute cat game?\\nHere is a peaceful animal forest where cats boil their delicious soup!\\nAn idle relaxing cat game perfect for cat moms and dads  =\u272a \u11ba \u272a=\\n\\n1.

It does feel that way sometimes but if you could just beat the game instantly what would be the point. No forced ads is amazing. You can watch them to speed up progression. The only thing is I wish they would lower the cost of changing a Cats ability. I watch enough ads to bring in revenue and with such a high chance for lower star rating and so many options it is hard to get cats with the correct skill and high stars. 250-300 per resetplease","This game is adorable. It was fun in the first couple days of playing but after building about 8 things, I would watch an ad for coins every time the chance popped up. It\'s annoying. I also have to level up my things so I would have less money so I\'d have to watch more ads. Ehm it just got boring and repetitive with me going absolutely nowhere. I am uninstalling it but it was cute while it lasted.","I want to like this so much. But as many have said : TOO MANY ADS. I\'m sick of watching ads for games or apps I\'ll never in a million years download. Also, after you pass the C coin level, it\'s pretty much impossible to level up. Its basically an ad app at this point because I can\'t level. I want to enjoy this because it was so fun at first. Now I might just uninstall it since I won\'t be getting any new stations anytime soon.","This game is absolutely adorable and so fun to play! It is heavy on ads but they\'re strictly opt in which is nice. My only complaint is it would be nice to have two separate options for upgrading by one level and another option to upgrade by 10 levels. I\'m a bit weird about even numbers so it bothers me when I\'m forced to upgrade more than I wanted to."],"appId":"com.hidea.cat","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hidea.cat&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.spcomes.esabyss":{"title":"Abyss : Rebirth Phantom","description":"\u25c8 Enjoy the Idle game X RPG X Cute girls(Bishojyo) at once!\\nYou don\'t have to play for a long time.

The character art is very well made and the pixel art isn\'t bad either. However, whenever I watch an ad and return to the game, the game starts lagging like crazy. There isn\'t a graphics option so I\'m forced to close and reopen the game whenever I watch an ad for anything. Hopefully this can be fixed. Other than that, I\'m enjoying it","Fairly straight forward. Lots of ways to get free diamonds as long as you have patience and lot of clicking through characters. Game progression gets slow after first couple episodes. Offline does not seem to register correctly as stages does not progress the supposed amount. Needs balancing to make the game seem like there\'s more progression/interest.","Fun game. But for the love of my sanity change back to the previous ad networks you used. I\'m sick and tired of all these scam \'make money quick\' ads. It\'s to the point where I will quit the game every 20 seconds just so I don\'t watch it for any of the ad rewards. Hell, if there was a way to pay $5 to remove ads I\'d do that","Well, I\'ve been playing the game for 1 month now and just got my 30-day login reward. The game is fun for the first 2 weeks, then progression becomes slower and slower as you rebirth and upgrade your heroes. It\'s been an entire month and I\'m still on level 4000, the game goes up to 12000. I like the fact that it\'s not hard to get diamonds, but the odds of gettin 4 or 5 stars characters are pretty low, but that\'s not an issue. It\'s a good game but the progression system needs a rework.","This game is okay so far, but it has tons of freezing, delayed response and it does have a few typos. Thanks for the game, hope you can fix these issues! Thanks in advance~ Hi, it\'s me again, just wanted to let you know that this game is freezing really badly.

The graphics, the gameplay, the sounds are good, except some sounds, for example, when you complete a mission, that sound isn\'t good for this game. The interface have so many things, it looks bad. The interface can be improved, for example when you go near of a character, the button to talk to him looks no good. The first cinematic when you start playing, at the end, the background looks bad. And I suggest one thing, dead sounds variations will be good.","Love this game ... It\'s hard to grind up the items needed to upgrade certin guns or animals and equally hard to gain the items that equip to ur person ...one thing I was wishing to b able to do was upgrade the abilities the person has ... Make them stronger by them selves .. other than that ... Great game... though also the vehicle is a bit hard to stear out of the way of lots of things ...","Fairly good rpg, I am removing a star however due to the forced screen orientation. It forced me to play the game in upside-down orientation on my tablet, which requires me to remove it from its dock. Other than this, what is to me an unnecessary feature, the game is decent and otherwise we\'ll crafted. Orientation probably is not as big a concern for phone players. Good game.","Overall ok game.

I admit, at first.. I thought it was totally lame.. But it only took me about 3 minutes to realize.. \'OK.. Maybe I was wrong.\' IT\'S FANTASTIC! Perfect for someone like me who has a hard time meditating my way out of being anxious.. It\'s the perfect distraction to focus my mind & relax so I can either get some sleep, or get on with my day. Since I started playing it.. My anxiety went from a 9 down to a more manageable 3 in less than 20 minutes.","An absolutely fantastic game. Beautiful graphics, even when simplistic. The puzzles start of easy and get more difficult as you progress. They never are impossible, you just need to think and try different permutations. The puzzles also change movements to keep your interest. And excellent game that is worth playing. You won\'t be sorry.","I can agree with these other reviews. Amazing game with beautiful pictures. I\'m not sure what the story is, but maybe it doesn\'t need one. It\'s beautiful as is. Music is fantastic, and as for the bugs and glitches, I have experienced the invisible puzzle piece glitch a couple of times. And sometimes the exit to level select button doesn\'t work. But other that, great game!","Very nice sliding puzzle game. Minimalist graphics -- which is not a bad thing at all here. The game music is gorgeous. The puzzles each have their own logic. In the earlier levels, the puzzles are very easy to solve. However, as you progress, they become increasingly difficult. The difficulty progression, by the way, is perfect. There are two issues, though, that I have with the game. First. it froze on me in a couple of levels, requiring that I restart those levels. Second, the story told by the game is much too obscure. I finished the game well enough -- but even then couldn\'t comprehend the story. On another note, some reviewers here said they finished the game in about an hour. That\'s nonsense. There are 70 levels. They would have had to have completed each level in less than a minute or so on average. Due to the imposing complexity of many of the more challenging puzzles in the later levels, that\'s simply impossible. So, either those reviewers have a completely wacked-out sense of time or they\'re greatly exaggerating their puzzle-solving abilities.","Top notch game. Music is nice and relaxing. The graphics are simple but look great. There are quite a bit of mechanics in game that may look hard but the stage progression makes sure that you understand how they work before mixing it up. Overall it\'s a great concept and it\'s a nice relaxing game to play. On a puzzle I didn\'t understand, I put my phone down for a minute, grabbed it again and apparently I was holding my phone upside down and that got me to solve the puzzle. If they released another game like this I would definitely play it. 10/10 No Regrets.

I\'ve been loving it ever since it came out! It\'s been LOADS of fun, I\'ve been looking for a fun pinball game, and World Flipper is just that! I love the music, and all the characters, as well as the art style. The gameplay is lovely. Keep up the great work! Only problems is it lags and now it lags even more. It worked better on Apple, but on Android... it just loads so slowly. There is also some...buffering in one of the last cutscenes from world 8.","Overall so far, it\'s really good! Cute art style, and it is just super great, other than a somewhat huge issue. They seem to be having account issues today (Sept 19 2021) and it logged me out! I don\'t know what it is doing to others\' accounts currently, but if each account that isn\'t linked to Google or Facebook is just being lost, that is pretty bad. Just a fair warning to new players. Note: This hasn\'t happened since, so I think it is safe to say that it isn\'t an issue.","Super fun game! But my complaint (like some others) is that the background is incredibly glitchy. I can\'t play for long because it truly messes with my eyes. Like similar complaints, I\'m using a Google Pixel 6. I would love to adjust my rating after this issue is solved and I can really get into playing.","Very enjoyable, fun mechanics, and despite it being a gacha game I found it very easy to roll and get good units. I offer two improvements that can be made to the game: 1: Deadeye is annoying to play. I like that you have to aim the shot but sometimes if you land in the middle of the flippers you literally can\'t aim and are forced to miss. It feels frustrating to get a 10+ combo and be forced to miss 2. Immune frames should exist! You should be immune to damage when you use your special","An innovative twist that combines pinball w/ active combat. Both the pixel art & character illustrations are very charming. There\'s also a large cast of characters, allowing for a lot of fun viable playstyles, even w/ lower star units. Although the story can sometimes be simplistic/clich\xe9d, it still has an element of mystery around it which is greatly enhanced by the dynamics b/w characters. The only main issue would probably be how the rewards for events can require a ton of tedious grinding."],"appId":"com.kakaogames.wdfp","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kakaogames.wdfp&hl=en&gl=us"},"cc.jasfun.wizard":{"title":"Super Wizard","description":"About Game\\nSuper Wizard is a Roguelike action game in which more than 20 magic skills can be chosen.

Game experience optimization","comments":["The dialogue moves too quickly in the intro, and anything you can read has been somewhat poorly translated. The game is certainly pretty, but almost laughably boring otherwise. There is a lot of missed potential here, and that is all but proven in another game which lacks the nice graphics of this one, and is by no means a beautiful game, but executes the idea *much* better. It is called Magic Survival. It\'s the exact same concept, but done well. I\'d say get that one instead..","I never complain about ads, ever! But you guys took an original, decent game in its own right, put some much needed polish on it, and then made immersion into the game all but IMPOSSIBLE. I would challenge the devs to play the game now as it stands. Go to level 8 and onwards and you have to watch a 30 second ad every 2 minutes just to stand a chance of beating these guys! I believe in financially supporting the devs of games I enjoy, but 30 dollars?? That\'s highway robbery. This is too bad.","Gameplay is alright. After leveling up you lose control when returning to the game which is annoying. Character moves super stupid slow, also annoying. Real reason for 1 star is how awful the ads are, the quality is garbage. To remove ads you have to pay 30 dollars. So my first two gripes are about very intentional choices to get you killed so you can watch a terrible ad so you\'re tempted to overpay for this utterly average game.","Pretty fun. The ad bonuses are too good to ignore, though, and there are a lot of ad bonuses. I think it would be more tolerable on a per-run or rechargeable set of activations basis, but like this I\'m just not inclined to keep beating my head against a wall (since there\'s a lot of grind) /and/ through hordes of ads. Rather do something else with my time.","This can easily gets 5 stars. I love everything about the game and it\'s really easy to lose track of time with this. Only problem I have is after an ad or choosing a skill you\'re left standing there and have to pick up/place your finger back down which has gotten me killed a couple times already. I would recommend a \\"press to continue\\" feature after those? Would eliminate the chance of getting wrecked because you had to choose a skill.

Unlocked Medusa, mostly epic gear, and can\'t do a damn thing in this game. Main quest? Chp 4 is unbeatable. Doom Tower? Stage 4 is unbeatable. All the \\"extra events\\". Can\'t kill anything in any of them, so pointless. I like the game but playing levels 2 & 3 over and over and over again is really boring at this point. Oh yeah, and good luck getting coins to upgrade. WAY TOO EXPENSIVE EVERYTHING! 2/5","I changed this to a 1 star and now deleted my original because I am disgusted by this business tactic. Don\'t buy the pass to remove the ads because it only removes the ads for the \\"season\\" which is like 17 days long. So every season you need to pay to get rid of the ads. It\'s not a 1 time thing. Very trashy tactic. Developer responded to my review with misinformation. First of all, I\'m aware of which ads were removed for when the pass was purchased. Second, the seasons are not 45 days long.","Love the challenging and strategic style of game play but like all other games like this, if you want to get past level 10, get your credit card ready, maybe two. You can always get a second job. Game makers don\'t care about 90% of the players. Prices are based on the 10% of losers who are willing to pay a thousand dollars plus to be the #1. To the losers who do that, thanks for ruining for everyone else.","No matter how far away I am from enemy attacks they still do damage. So I\'m basically just playing to lose. Great job on this game guys. And way to rip off all the enemy attacks from other games. Uninstalled and I wish I could get my \\"ad removing\\" money back. Spoiler alert, it\'ll still give you ads.","Enjoyable game for its genre. Has good graphics, decent upgrades. BUGGY. After 90 seconds, game lags to 2 frames per minute, then locks up solid. Good news is the game autosaves correctly and closes easily. But you will have to restart the game every 90 seconds on average."],"appId":"co.imba.archero","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.imba.archero&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.gamigo.ext.town":{"title":"Fantasy Town: Farm & Friends","description":"Build your vibrant town replete with talented citizens, plant a farm full of prospering crops, or produce valuable goods like milk and eggs on an animal farm!

I don\'t know if this is because the trolls mission is new or a bug but I want to have it fixed.","First off the overall gameplay is ok but there\'s lots of improvements that are needed like buying Items the time needs to be much shorter like I would say every 20 minutes instead of over an 1 hr. The other major issue is certain products should be made a lot quicker currently they take too long to make. I would give this game 5 stars but the game needs to be better improved.","I really love this game! People who complain about the tutorial going on forever, obviously have little to no patience. You can easily skip tutorials and the info is pretty useful anyways. It\'s like township but less complex, and the storyline is really fun to follow! I got this game yesterday and I\'m already level 12.. so maybe make gaining xp a little harder as you level up?","I don\'t mind an ad here and there on a free game. Maybe if I like the game I\'ll throw some money around and stick with the game for as long as I\'m interested. What I cannot tolerate, are ads that take me out of the game, to google play or whatever, and purposefully make it difficult to return to the game. Maybe if these ads are fixed I\'ll try again.","Finally a game where all the floor decorations are free! Decoratives are at a good price. It\'s really easy to earn currency. By helping other people, you can gain specific coins to purchase some decorative stuff. This game has a cute plot and progresses. People complain about the timing for stuff is too long but that\'s why this game has \\"farmers, knights, mages, etc\\" to help boost. Upgrade them to higher stars to make production faster! Only suggestion is providing more ways to use the guild."],"appId":"com.gamigo.ext.town","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gamigo.ext.town&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.playdigious.sparklite":{"title":"Sparklite","description":"Try Sparklite for free until the first Titan! \\n\\nSparklite is an Action-Adventure roguelite set in a whimsical and ever-changing land.\\n\\nGear up for Adventure and battle foes in top-down action using an arsenal of gadgets, guns, and gear.

My only complaints are that the controls can be poor (especially for the blimp bomb), the procedural generation is not varied enough to keep the maps interesting, and the game itself is quite grindy for resources to help push into deeper maps. That combined makes me play the game for a bit, then get bored, and months later okay it a bit more for a little while. Near-miss to potentially genius game.","Not a well designed game. Prices for upgrades are extremely high. It\'s more efficient to run straight to the casino and then reset than wandering the same ten map tiles fighting the same three enemy types. Basic enemies take off nearly half your life in one hit, even with upgrades. Many required tools aren\'t permanent upgrades but random drops. Hope you get a lamp this run if you want to see in the caves. And the lamp has three charges, so your walk into the cave is going to be a one-way trip.","Thank you so much for fixing the dualshock controller support! Now I can enjoy the game! I\'ve loved it from day 1, but the mobile controls were just making things way too difficult. I figured I\'d better check and see if it was fixed before I decided to re-purchase it on Switch, and wouldn\'t ya know! It\'s a very fun roguelike style game. Neat buffs you can find, and you only have so much room for them at one time, so choose wisley! I highly recommend this for retro RPG fans!","Top notch mobile RPG. Excellent controls that are simple and responsive, mechanics to match and from what I\'ve grasped of the story so far its all around one of the best mobile RPGs I\'ve played (And I\'ve played close to all of them, or at least far more than most \ud83d\ude02). I\'d easily rate this 6/5, definitely worth the 6.99. Or just have fun with the free trial, ( Don\'t kill the boss)","Absolutely fantastic game! Good leveling, good art, Great difficulty spike near the end. The only reason why I\'m giving it a two star is because I finally collected all of the notes and once I did the final song doesn\'t play! Was it a big MP3 file that got optimized out accidentally? I\'m on a pixel 6 pro. Anyway, I\'ll update my review if this is fixed."],"appId":"com.playdigious.sparklite","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.playdigious.sparklite&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.redspell.nanotanks":{"title":"Tanks vs Bugs","description":"Where archers fail, tanks rush in and prevail!\\nAs our general would always say: \u2018A tank-sized bug can only be handled by a TANK!\u2019 And this planet has them aplenty, right for everybody to have fun with!\\n\\nThe game features:\\n* Simple and intuitive controls;\\n* Various tanks, each has its unique combat style and strategy;\\n* Diverse enemy fauna demanding individual approach and tactics to defeat;\\n* Great many efficient combinations of combat skills to take advantage of in battles.\\n\\nGet into your tank and go decimate the bugs side by side with us!","descriptionHTML":"Where archers fail, tanks rush in and prevail!<br>As our general would always say: \u2018A tank-sized bug can only be handled by a TANK!\u2019 And this planet has them aplenty, right for everybody to have fun with!<br><br>The game features:<br>* Simple and intuitive controls;<br>* Various tanks, each has its unique combat style and strategy;<br>* Diverse enemy fauna demanding individual approach and tactics to defeat;<br>* Great many efficient combinations of combat skills to take advantage of in battles.<br><br>Get into your tank and go decimate the bugs side by side with us!","summary":"Where archers fail, tanks rush in and prevail!","installs":"500,000+","minInstalls":500000,"maxInstalls":526524,"score":3.86,"scoreText":"3.9","ratings":5583,"reviews":128,"histogram":{"1":720,"2":331,"3":606,"4":1224,"5":2677},"price":0,"free":true,"currency":"USD","priceText":"Free","available":true,"offersIAP":true,"IAPRange":"$0.99 - $24.99 per item","androidVersion":"5.1","androidVersionText":"5.1","developer":"Games Extras","developerId":"4837947296438587941","developerEmail":"tanksbugs@mail.redspell.ru","developerWebsite":"http://redspell.games/support_mobile","developerAddress":"815 N.

Level 16 to be exact. The first boss is not beatable and all my tanks are fully upgraded, 4th star level on one and full gear while playing the other modes. Every game in this genre falls into the same category.. If the developers would make it so you don\'t just endlessly fail on one level, maybe I would spend more money. The VIP level details are also locked behind the first purchase. It goes from $0.99 to $5.99. Wish I knew that BEFORE.","Unplayable game. Freezes on level 4 every time you collect the first mech piece. Game acts like it\'s playing, but tank is unmovable, cannot progress to next level. The joystick still looks like it\'s moving but the tank doesn\'t move. I liked the idea of this, it\'s to bad it\'s not playable.","This game looked pretty good for the first hour. Now it crashes constantly, mid run, and of course, you don\'t get credit for the crash, nor do you get the energy OR the prizes for completion. This kills games fast, and this one seems no different. Avoid, unless you enjoy frustration.","Alright gameplay. Daily rewards stop at day 16. Adverts don\'t work 90% the time. No possible way to get certain tanks without paying. An option to bin cards and receive a new one would be nice. Same for a vendor who sells parts for coins or other surplus parts.","I took my 5star back. The game freezes and I\'ve been writing emails to the developers to assist after I\'ve spent a lot of money on the game but no assistance. Very disappointed with the developers for not paying attention to players. If you decide to play this game, don\'t spend any money on it...

Games are design to be fun and progress but to force loot boxes to power up is pretty dumb.","Suprisingly good take on the roguelike genre! Instead of being that portrait mode game, that there\'s thousands of nearly identical clones of, this game does the autofire system, with weapons/armor upgrade at the end of each stage, same as others, but does it in landscape mode, unique, innovative graphics, great home base layout, intuitive u.i. The whole game takes a popular genre, turns it on its ear, and totally nails it in the process! GREAT game. Very pleasantly surprised!","So far so good fast paced futuristic RPG style rouge like,thats easy to learn and hard to master.. I will be editing this review after I get deeper into the story (first impression) (Update) Do yourself a favor and play this game\xa1! It is still a work in progress but it Looks and Plays Great, excluding the small fact that the underground rental shop does not work yet, But just take it as a challenge and dive right into the game for a hardcore cyberpunk roguelike experience you won\'t soon forget.","I\'ve tried a lot of games that draw inspiration from Archero, but they all lack originality. This completely reimagines that game and makes it much better. I would definitely recommend this to a friend. There\'s a few things, such as about 1% of the time, when you clear a floor, one bullet wont get destroyed. We need a menu to see what upgrades we\'ve gotten during a run. Standing Shoot is the worst upgrade in the game(is just like damage upgrade except it doesnt work when you\'re moving)","Very fun and challenging. I\'ve played a few \'auto shooters\' because but this one is different in all the good ways. Its challenging but fair it seems. Only thing I am having problem with is trying to figure out where and how you get the memories. Is there like some kind of challenge you have to do? Like take no damage during a boss run?

I like being able to collect different things and upgrade, but to really get decent stuff, you may need to spend money for upgrades. It gets repetitive in terms of gameplay, and without real money, its slow to obtain gems and upgrades. I will state that it is a decent game, its free so can\'t complain.","Normally I don\'t rate games but this one is pretty amazing. The chain reactions make a huge difference in game play along with you don\'t find your self wanting to buy rubies for anything extra. Though once you start getting into the added maps or the daily you start running out of energy a lot faster because they require more then 1 a normal game eats up. But the ads don\'t pop up nearly as often on some other games which I truly enjoy. You only watch them when and if you want to.","Decent enough app, at least on the off chance that you can play it without insufferable lag. The gameplay of the game is, collect/ upgrade cards + collect/ upgrade equipment + timed levels where if you take too long your try was worthless, oh, and don\'t forget the near constant lag. It wouldn\'t be as bad if the whole game froze but no, instead the game keeps running and ignores any taps/ input. So, good job?","Really fun game, would be immeasurably improved by actually being able to play it for more than about 10 minutes at a time. Even with the first cap upgrade the energy system is just too stingy. Something like a zero-cost, zero-loot mine that grants energy for reaching the idol could go a long way to improving the issue, without hopelessly unbalancing everything? Right now it\'s mostly a game about waiting.","I actually like the first pocket mine compared to this one. the first pocket mine gave you challenges to complete and you were able to go deeper without limit a d there were no monster. this one has too much going on. there aren\'t any challenges. too many different levels that end too fast. and the only thing you really customize is your gear. it gets repetitive and boring. the graphics are nice but that\'s about it"],"appId":"ca.roofdog.pm3","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ca.roofdog.pm3&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.grand.survival.ocean.adventure":{"title":"Grand Survival - Raft Games","description":" Grand Survival  is a  marvelous survival game   with unforgettable experience! \\n\\nBrave an ocean full of mysteries and danger with nothing but your wits and your raft.

Clothing is really annoying to craft and doesn\'t last long for the cost. The reason I gave this game 2 stars is bc your character will ignore resources that you can be standing directly on top of bc the game prioritizes nearby enemies. It just will not let you interact with them at all, and it\'s maddening. Not interested in playing this game as long as this is an issue.","I really like this game compared to other survival games. Good graphics that are somewhat adjustable to save battery/memory. I like the cartoon-like graphics. It does need a little polishing. For instance, in your backpack when you have stuff on the furthest left slots the pop-up text is off-screen and unreadable. Controls get a little whacky when between zombies/crabs/whatever and resources. It\'ll target the enemy over resources and you can\'t get the resource until you kill the enemy.","All crafted items don\'t last long enough. Its a chore carrying 3 axes and 3 weapons to rubber island. Clothing or armor isn\'t strong enough. Glitches at the downed plane zombies are already dead. Go back to raft to depot, come back and they are all back roaming. Upgrades are too expensive when you can only get the gears at the hotel. Need better daily prizes for consecutive login. Gears maybe?? 20 to upgrade loom?! Movement is wonky. Good graphics though. It\'s worth trying out.","Update to my first post, don\'t know why it won\'t let me edit it. Upgrade my rating to 4 star from 2 star since they fix glitch with jellyfish. Again very good game with nice graphics. The only reason it\'s not 5 star is because I think the game needs just a few tweaks like other players suggested. Mainly for me it\'s the quick weapons and armor degradation, and the low energy. Wish they made your energy increase along with your leveling up. Anyway if you like survival games try this one.","This is a great game. There are a few bugs, for example, putting items in storage is really buggy. I have to open the storage multiple times, because it won\'t allow me to put items in. Also in the backpack I try to combine sets of like 2 and 3 peices of wood and it doesn\'t work. But other than a few bugs, it\'s a really good game. Good graphics.

However, there are many bugs within the game such as some ads that are watched to respawn not working after being watched. There isn\'t even a use for tickets inside the game (that I know of, correct me if I\'m wrong) and I feel that some levels are impossible for players who didn\'t grind.","To be clear I love this game. I know I gave it 2 stars but that is honestly because the game is not complete yet. I played the beta version of this and while this is much better than that one in many ways; it\'s still not finished. There\'s a lot the devs have to do. The movement/ attack controls are buggy. The loot drop system needs to be overhauled as I need to literally play one level 20+ times before a specific item will drop. This includes bosses. The cost of extraction is a bit too high too.","Great game. There are item drop frequency issues, stability problems, and minor control bugs, but I give it 5 stars because I know the game is a work in progress and updates are frequent. I am confident these things will be fixed. I played the Beta version, and it seems weapons can be upgraded much faster in this version....a very good change. Making most of the ads optional where the player is rewarded for doing so is great, too.","Excellent game. I cant tell if this is a sequel to the original or if it\'s a remake or what... but I have both versions installed & find them both to be great. Only issue I have is that I\'d like the controls to respond better. Very often it takes a couple button presses to start moving or to jump. As a platformer this seems like something that should be improved upon. But other then that, Very well done! Hey cool... I\'m from CT too. Keep up the good work fellow statesmen/women Lol :)","Played the first swordman in early development. There is no improvement. Not graphical, not performance, not feel for controls, not simplicity. I played through as many levels as I could handle but it\'s pretty much the same as the first game. I didn\'t enjoy the hand-holdy annoying tutorial that just makes you do things against your will without explaining them well (don\'t remember this from the first but they might\'ve implemented it later on).

Do you enjoy supply chain woes? Then this game is for you. Simple enough to start, but quite challenging pretty quickly. You think you\'re doing fine, then you run out of resources and it takes the next two hours to finish the last quarter of the mission. The story isn\'t great, and it gets grindy, but it\'s also a decent time suck.","This game is exceptionally difficult to control. Zooming in and out is almost impossible, even though it is a GAME CRITICAL NECESSITY. Even using my stylus for extra accuracy, the game will still select conveyor belts beside the thing you\'re trying to select AND THEN REFUSES TO DESELECT unless you move away and specifically select a grassy tile to force it to let go. Online help is pointless since the only results you are given concern REFRACTORY. Good game ruined by poor control.","still in the beginning stages but so far this is a pretty well designed crafting/survival game. the interface is extremely well designed and fluid and I\'m not fighting the controls in the slightest like I have in the past. even the design of the actual structures relieve the stress of building yourself into corners and making you redesign the most basic setups which of course makes it proportionately harder later on. it\'s reminiscent of factorio in its top down design but not stressful.","A good demo for a promising game, free version needs more content though. It wasn\'t long enough for me to determine if I would actually enjoy playing the full game. I\'ve played games like this one before where conveyor logistics were a major part of the game mechanics, and this one appears to address some of the issues that made those games tedious in the end, but once again, the demo doesn\'t let you explore the game enough for me to be sure.","I really enjoy this game, however I lost about 30 minutes of chapter 1, because the game doesn\'t have a back button or save button when you\'re actually playing in a mission, which I assumed meant it auto-saved. It doesn\'t. I just closed the game out not realizing this. But, you have to press the back button on your phone itself, then a menu will open to save the game.

Leave a review :)","comments":["Great game, poor customer service. Not sure why players are giving up by level 100, some of the options they want aren\'t available til 120- 200. So it\'s not the garbage they say, highly recommended game \ud83e\udd14. Side quests, events, \\"Hell Mode\\", castle gets bigger accommodating more heroes and towers. If you keep \\"grinding \\" which is the point of tins of games, it gets better. Don\'t listen to one person\'s opinion, and try it for yourself.","I\'ve grown weary of TD games that start out ok, then suddenly turn stupidly impossible at a certain level. So, this game caught my eye. User reviews made it clear that, while repetitive, you could advance and grow if you\'re willing to grind and watch some advertising. On this front, yes -- Wild Castle indeed is a game you can keep playing and playing, and I\'d like to thank the developers for this. If you\'re looking for a frustration-free TD game, go ahead and install it. But what needs to happen now is for the game to evolve so that there\'s more to do. In the game right now, with all the loot you earn from the perpetual grinding, you can upgrade your heroes, upgrade your turrets, and/or invest in various perks so that you can... uh you guessed it \u2026 keep grinding. The game is in desperate need for more ways to benefit from the work you put into it. How about more ways to design and develop your town, how about some adventures and campaigns, how about some events where you choose certain heroes to got toe-to-toe with certain villains, how about puzzles that we can solve for special rewards, how about the ability to occupy new castles and expand one\'s kingdom. Just anything to break the monotony. The opportunity is there, but right now, the game is just a repetitive dead-end, good for about a week or two of engagement.","It\'s so simple, I can\'t call it tower defense, but it\'s still very enjoyable. Waves of monsters roll towards your castle, and your defenders shoot them down. Upgrade to use more heroes, towers and archers, and enhance the abilities of the defenders and the castle itself. It\'s an endless loop, but it has stayed fun past level 300, so the devs did something right. Ads are optional, never thrust in your face. Recommended.","It\'s simple and repetitive. Can be decent while waiting at a doctor\'s office or something like that. Although there gets to a point where it\'s hard to improve and you feel stuck. Any improvement after a certain point comes in such small increments that tougher levels need way too much grinding. Also had to turn the music off early on. Just one song on loop.","The gameplay boils down to a never ending treadmill run that keeps going faster, but you earn points by running that you can use to increase your speed. Nothing really changes, and you don\'t go anywhere, you\'re just running in place. You have the option to watch ads and/or spend money if you want to put in less effort. You also can pay extra to have the computer run for you. Does paying a game to watch it play itself seem like an absurd thing to do to anyone else?"],"appId":"com.wildsky.wildcastle","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wildsky.wildcastle&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.com.tann.dice":{"title":"Slice & Dice","description":"Free demo, no ads, single IAP to unlock the full game.\\n\\nTake control of 5 heroes, each with their own dice.

It\'s a rogue like with what I can only assume is infinite replayability. There are LOADS of items and class upgrades that, when combined, can lead you to victory or ruin in so many ways. I would be willing to bet no two people have ever had the same run after they unlocked a twentieth of the items through playing the game. Keep it up!!","This game is terrific. The free install lets you play a demo, with the full game costing 7 dollars. So you don\'t have to take anyone\'s word for it. Give it a try yourself. I was impressed with the demo playthrough, and after buying the full version, I\'m even more impressed. Mechanically the game is simple but still requires good decision making, and the difficulty feels just right. As you progress you\'ll unlock more ways to deepen the experience. One of the better rougelites on Android.","This is one of the top games I\'ve ever played on mobile. The amount of variation and replay value is insane. Between characters, items, spells, leveling (you promote to new classes), modes, and difficulty, you get an incredible difference each game. I truly wish this game was still being worked on, but it\'s still 5 stars for me and will be playing this for years to come.","I love this game. It\'s exactly what I want in a turn based roguelike. One suggestion, allow players to skip the first 20 levels of curse mode by picking a bunch of curses and a boon. I can consistently get thru the first 20 levels, but it takes so long. I want to skip straight to the challenging bit.","Absolutely love this game. Have spent 30+ hours playing. One of the best mobile games out there. It has a steep learning curve if you\'re like me and too stubborn to read the rules at first, but once you get the swing of it it\'s very addictive and fun! Only one request: can there please be some kind of easily visible indicator that a dice is one that \\"must be rolled\\".

A few month later, after a long break: still a great games. Pros: The game excellently provides exciting fantasy adventure with lots of cool and funny moments, without taking away from realist tragedy befalling each world. Character progress is quite simple with time. Energy is not much of problem. Lots of story/sub-story. Your choice matter in the story. Cons: Is a gacha, be lucky. precise movement is a pain! The story difficulty spike","Overall I love it, but do have a few issues. The skill gap between player vs enemies gets to be too much to handle. Haven\'t been able to progress past the 2nd stage of World 11 part 2 because of this. There\'s also something wrong with the agora minigame in the Afterworld Inc. side story. I\'m certain I\'m selecting the correct evidence, but Charon catches me and I always lose anyway. Guess I\'m giving up on this part until the issue is addressed. Really do love this game, though.","Extremely fun game with many exciting and interesing things to do, if your stuck there are many ways to get over that, if you want better items, you can save up to trade things, if you don\'t have enough of something like gold or EXP theres something for that too! This game offers many rewards and possibilities, so you should definitely check it out!","So far, not bad... if overly simplistic. Took out a lv30 enemy with a level 18 character. Bow is super powerful. Edit: fast forward a couple of years. I haven\'t played in maybe a year, but the one before, I probably dumped $3k in, and totally enjoyed the game. It gets INTENSELY challenging, and it feels crazy having a max/EX character and still get stomped in story mode. I\'d say the game is very much worth playing!","EDIT: the game has started to freeze my phone up causing my system ui to crash and stop working. It happens everytime now and I\'ll start lagging during the worst times causing me to close app or my system ui stops working and freezes my phone. I\'ve Uninstalled game and even deleted a few apps even though I have enough storage. I love this game. Such cute graphics and the story mode is very enjoyable and interesting. I am having a lot of fun with this game.

Until the recent anomoly which lets you play old events (which I think is great!). 12 events, and you have to play whichever you choose 3 times in the less-than week it gives you for the highest tier reward. I worked hard, bought energy once, and still only managed two. It\'s too much for the short time limit :(","Probably near the best casual adventure/farming game I\'ve played. First and foremost, the story and characters are actually interesting! Secondly, the developers are very hands on with constant new content. They keep the story line moving at a consistent pace and make sure you get special adventures popping up a few times a month. You always have a little down time to gather energy so you don\'t have to spend cash though a little here and there supports the game and content! :) 9/10","When I tell you that energy runs out super fast, I mean SUPER FAST!! You get to play, literally, 5-10 minutes before not being able to do ANYTHING for at least 30 minutes. Maybe I\'m missing a way to get more energy quicker. No ads that I experienced, no bugs or glitches up to where I am, which isn\'t far. You can spend cash and prices are typical of mobile games, but you could spend alot QUICK. I just can\'t forgive the loss of energy unbelievably fast. UNINSTALLED","Great game and story lines. Exceptional customer service! I have been playing this game every day for two years and never grow tired of it. I have never \\"HAD\\" to purchase anything for any reason to keep going. This game has the most beautiful and vibrant graphics and there seems to always be a new challenge or island to keep it interesting. The characters become like close friends after a while. I really hope this game never ends!","Really love this game, the storyline and animation are top. Yeah it takes a while to get enough energy to really get going but once past a certain level there are so many options to get energy that you can accumulate quite a bit if you strategize. It\'s fun to play, defo 10/10"],"appId":"com.vizorapps.atlantis","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vizorapps.atlantis&hl=en&gl=us"},"tdcgame.zombie.idle.defense":{"title":"Zombie Idle Defense","description":"Hunt zombies and be a city king.\\n\ud83d\udc4dDefend against the zombie army\\nAn exciting, incredibly dynamic and terribly atmospheric strategy game with RPG elements that give you hours of real pleasure, and allows you to enjoy thoughtful gameplay.

Constant leveling and plenty of gear to pick up. But then like most of these games, you hit that one level that drastically increases the difficulty, your enemies have exponentially more highpoint than the previous level, and the only way around it is to spend money. It\'s a shame, this could have been a spectacular game. Then something funny happened. The developers actually listened to feedback. They fixed the issue And improved the gameplay. BRAVO!","Buggy, with some design flaws. It\'s mostly just grinding, but I enjoyed it. It does taper off lamely where there\'s little to do in the late game, so I quit. There is one character that specializes in weapons that don\'t seem to be offered except as $5 cash purchase, but generally everything else seems to be accessible. It is designed to get you to watch tons of ads by rewarding you for each one, but that seems fair.","I love this game! It\'s very addicting and I only have 2 stages left, all characters at S level and many guns almost at epic level. I enjoy seeing the progress and also playing idle mode gives you so much more rewards. I\'d definitely like to see more maps and different types of events. Currently I\'m having an issue. I was playing on one phone and it died on me. Just got a new phone today and my progress is lost as well as all the app purchases I made. Please help me to restore my account.","Not a bad game...but not what it says on the label (-2 stars). You have to work through 30 levels before you can get to any sort of \\"idle\\" growth, and most progress still has to be made with actively playing the game (-2 stars). That being said, the game is pretty entertaining, if heavy on the \'pay-to-win\' side. The controls and gameplay are fairly simple, the weapon upgrades are reminiscent of a merge game, and there\'s still enough free stuff to not make you feel like an ad slave. (+1 star)","I would give it 5 stars if there were more levels. I believe that if I had been patient enough to keep replaying levels, I could have saved more real money. Even at the pace I played, it didn\'t take much to reach the last level in 10 days. Once you beat Las Vegas and London, each day you get a Hero chest to augment what you have. As I said, patience to repeat levels can really save you real money. It is a fun game that is similar to a Tower Defense game without the placement strategies."],"appId":"tdcgame.zombie.idle.defense","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tdcgame.zombie.idle.defense&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.xtt.iasurv2":{"title":"Idle Arks: Build at Sea","description":"\ud83c\udf0aOnce, a sudden flood submerged every town.

You can\'t click away from her. There\'s no option to remove ads, and the \\"watch ad\\" crates are more prevalent than actual resources. Not worth the time.","I downloaded this app a few years ago and really enjoyed it, I changed phones and forgot about it until yesterday. I had been playing for a few hours and had built 6 rafts, I go to start the 7th raft and the app completely glitched. It asked me to submerge even though there was nothing built. It then froze. I restarted it a few times and the survivors where floating around. It would freeze on the welcome back screen. I uninstalled and reinstalled, lost all my progress.","Its alright as a game if you are trying to get rewards from another game, but if you aren\'t there isn\'t much of a point. It can get pretty grindy, and if you aren\'t patient you still have to watch ads. :l Luckily most are skippable or you can just exit out of them by pressing the back button. There are also a few typos but its still alright.","I actually enjoyed the game very much. The only problem I found was the occasional event that is impossible without purchasing the special event character. Understood, you need to make money, that\'s why I had no problem watching upwards of 50 ads each time I sit down to play. P.S. I am certain, there were many perfect executions of the battle without a single sign that any amount of luck would even be enough","The game itself isn\'t bad honestly. My main issue is the \\"achievements\\". Once you do complete any of them, you have to watch an ad to claim your reward. It feels more like rewards for ads, as opposed to rewards for actually getting the achievement.

Ads are not too invasive unless you want to get something extra. Even gems can be obtained without paying money: you just have to be a bit patient. Kudos to developers! One issue is that once you advance to the next region, you can not get trains for the previous one except if you spend a lot gems. Those are very expensive (in terms of time or real money) and with each purchase you only get a small chance to get the trains that you miss, which makes it even more expensive.","Train WRECK Station still. Game crashes frequently. Doesn\'t matter what I\'m doing or not doing, game crashes frequently. Doesn\'t matter if this is the only thing I\'m running on my phone or switching between this and other apps, game crashes frequently. Game crashes in all phases of game play. It\'s a train wreck. Typical developer, won\'t try to solve their bugs, just asks to be contacted via a support email, chat, etc. \\"Please tell us what the problem is.\\" The problem is described above.","It\'s a good game and I do enjoy it but I wish it was closer to the original train station. collecting hundreds of different types of wagons was my favorite hobby on it. although I do enjoy playing the special events more on this one. like the American railway project where you could earn several locamotives that I liked the look of. And I apologize for my original review being disrespectful, I like the game and I didn\'t realize till now that you can upgrade the amount of trains you can run.","If you like trains, as I do, this game is awesome. It is a laid back game that is truly entertaining. You can collect resources without the fear of someone raiding your station before you upgrade something. The Regions are well designed, with exquisitely detailed background scenery. The physics of the trains navigating the tracks is extremely accurate. Sometimes it seems to take forever to complete Jobs, but that just gives me time to do something around the house. Highly recommend. Try it!!!","I haven\'t played in a while and when I came back I was very disappointed. The sounds are very different, it now sounds like a cheap mobile game that rely on adds. The game play is perfect. I have 3 suggestions (1 make a classic mode, like make it possible to take the sound, graphics etc, back to say 2019. (2 the ability to replay events like if you really want a train and the event ended you could replay it in the shop. (3 the ability to move trains from one reagon to another. -your biggest fan."],"appId":"com.pixelfederation.ts2","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pixelfederation.ts2&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.kongregate.mobile.tinkerisland.google":{"title":"Tinker Island - Survival Story Adventure","description":"You\'re cast away on a TROPICAL ISLAND.

While it is mainly an Idle game, you are able to unlock a mode that allows it to be a fullly fledged game. The controls are responsive, the graphics look nice, the text narrator is funny, the puzzles are nice and complicated and there is a lot of content to keep you busy. That content isn\'t even just busy work as it helps your main goal progress further. My only issue is with the garden and the fact that you can\'t automatically restart when you wish too.","I loved this game, i played through most of it once and i decided to come back to finish the story. Now theres way more ads than before. Ads everytime it opens, ads while i placing survivors to tasks, ads telling me to go watch other ads to get rewards. I get mobile games have ads but i dont need them swarming the game while im reading important story.","I love the concept of the game along with the good story. The biggest issue with it is that after installing and playing it the game freezes on the storyline and won\'t let me click the button to continue and when i try to re-enter the game it never loads me in and forcing me to uninstall because it is unplayable. Same thing happens for tinker 2 so I don\'t know what the problem is.","I\'ve played before, tried again to see if it changed, it didn\'t. Ads, and so on, yeah it\'s free but, the progress is extremely slow, you\'re also lucky if your survivors don\'t die before you find more. I love the concept, the story is pretty neat. The options and chances make it pretty interesting, but if you want true success you need to pay. It\'s a phone app. Either charge for the game or make it 100% free. Stop this in app purchase bull****... uninstall... second time....","I like the game while it\'s actually working, but it lags pretty badly after a bit... a short bit. Like 10 mins. I have a relatively newer phone, too, so I doubt it\'s something to do with my end. The lag makes it difficult to drag cards around, view the map and the flower garden is... buggier than a bug bomb could fix! I\'ve missed out on quite a few of those gemdactyl things, too. Without the lag, this is a rather nice game. I just wish I didn\'t need friends to enjoy certain parts of it. :/"],"appId":"com.kongregate.mobile.tinkerisland.google","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kongregate.mobile.tinkerisland.google&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.FunFlavorGames.HeroPark":{"title":"Hero Park","description":"Welcome to Hero Park,\\n\\nthe place where magical unicorns attract heroes into your town for their own little adventure.

The town is empty and the once glorious dungeons are now abandoned. The decision is clear: the town must be rebuilt, new monsters bred and the dungeons populated again.\\n\\nCreate the perfect illusion of an adventure town with busy blacksmiths, bustling taverns, and glorious dungeons with monsters bred by you. Meet fascinating characters who want to join you and use their skills to lure the hero\'s gold out of their purses. Make Hero Park what it used to be: the most magnificent town in the kingdom!\\n\\nFeatures:\\n\u2605 More than 100 fabulous characters: heroes, shop keepers, vampires, unicorns and more\\n\u2605 Design your town according to your wishes and automate your production\\n\u2605 Breed monsters for your dungeons and shape them according to your needs\\n\u2605 Immerse yourself in the magical world of elves, humans and dwarves\\n\u2605 Experience the exciting story of an old war hero and his unicorn\\n\u2605 Solve exciting quests and loot valuable treasures...\\n\u2605 ... and stop your unicorn from eating everything!\\n\\n\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nFrequently asked questions (FAQ)\\n\\n\\n1. How can I have the heroes trained?\\n\\nThere are several ways to increase the chance of training. It is especially helpful if the hero has bought an experience potion (yellow potion) beforehand. The chance of training is also increased if the hero can defeat a high level monster or defeats several monsters.\\n\\n\\n2. How can I have a hero blessed?\\n\\nA hero wants to be blessed after having his suffering (e.g. diseases caused by undead monsters) treated in the temple. The different blessings are only valid for certain races. So in the beginning only one blessing is available for elves and it can be helpful to attract as many elves as possible to the village.\\n\\n\\n3. How can I reduce the charging time of the unicorn energy?\\n\\nThe recharge time can be reduced by up to 10 minutes. This is done by ranking daily tasks (from level 10, up to 4 minutes), Santa\'s brother (from level 11, 2 minutes) and using the unicorn trainer (from level 20, up to 4 minutes). With Santa\'s brother there is also the possibility to produce unicorn food, which can be used instead of energy.\\n\\n\\n4. How can I delete or reposition a building?\\n\\nSelect a building and open the building menu with the button in the upper left corner. Select \\"Store building\\". If you now want to move this building somewhere else, click on an empty field and select the building from your storage. \\n\\n\\n5. Can I find improvements in treasure chests for employees who cannot be found in treasure chests?\\n\\nAs soon as an employee is on your team, you can find improvements in treasure chests with the same probability.\\n\\n\\n6. I can\'t get any further with the task \\"In your village you need 10 cats\\" and need a tip?\\n\\nThis task can only be solved at level 28.

This is the story of you, your unicorn and a treasury full of gold!<br><br>Five years after the Great War, the old war hero and his faithful unicorn return to their home town and find that not a stone is left standing on another. The town is empty and the once glorious dungeons are now abandoned. The decision is clear: the town must be rebuilt, new monsters bred and the dungeons populated again.<br><br>Create the perfect illusion of an adventure town with busy blacksmiths, bustling taverns, and glorious dungeons with monsters bred by you. Meet fascinating characters who want to join you and use their skills to lure the hero&#39;s gold out of their purses. Make Hero Park what it used to be: the most magnificent town in the kingdom!<br><br>Features:<br>\u2605 More than 100 fabulous characters: heroes, shop keepers, vampires, unicorns and more<br>\u2605 Design your town according to your wishes and automate your production<br>\u2605 Breed monsters for your dungeons and shape them according to your needs<br>\u2605 Immerse yourself in the magical world of elves, humans and dwarves<br>\u2605 Experience the exciting story of an old war hero and his unicorn<br>\u2605 Solve exciting quests and loot valuable treasures...<br>\u2605 ... and stop your unicorn from eating everything!<br><br><br><br>-----------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Frequently asked questions (FAQ)<br><br><br>1. How can I have the heroes trained?<br><br>There are several ways to increase the chance of training. It is especially helpful if the hero has bought an experience potion (yellow potion) beforehand. The chance of training is also increased if the hero can defeat a high level monster or defeats several monsters.<br><br><br>2. How can I have a hero blessed?<br><br>A hero wants to be blessed after having his suffering (e.g. diseases caused by undead monsters) treated in the temple. The different blessings are only valid for certain races. So in the beginning only one blessing is available for elves and it can be helpful to attract as many elves as possible to the village.<br><br><br>3. How can I reduce the charging time of the unicorn energy?<br><br>The recharge time can be reduced by up to 10 minutes. This is done by ranking daily tasks (from level 10, up to 4 minutes), Santa&#39;s brother (from level 11, 2 minutes) and using the unicorn trainer (from level 20, up to 4 minutes). With Santa&#39;s brother there is also the possibility to produce unicorn food, which can be used instead of energy.<br><br><br>4. How can I delete or reposition a building?<br><br>Select a building and open the building menu with the button in the upper left corner. Select &quot;Store building&quot;. If you now want to move this building somewhere else, click on an empty field and select the building from your storage. <br><br><br>5. Can I find improvements in treasure chests for employees who cannot be found in treasure chests?<br><br>As soon as an employee is on your team, you can find improvements in treasure chests with the same probability.<br><br><br>6. I can&#39;t get any further with the task &quot;In your village you need 10 cats&quot; and need a tip?<br><br>This task can only be solved at level 28. Once you have cats in your village, remember that all cats need love.

It\'s more like an idle game than something to play actively. Early on, there are some interesting building portions. After that, the main gameplay is completing challenges, restocking resources, and hero improvement. That does not drive me to keep playing as the challenges are meh. There is no combat to directly influence and the \\"city building\\" part is pretty bare bones. If there was an incentive to keep playing, the energy system is pretty low payout.","The game starts out at a good pace with fun mechanics. Once you hit about midgame and the unicorn statue unlocking, everything becomes an exponentially longer wait with no way to scale \\"the business\\". You\'ll think \\"ah. This is just the plateau to cross and there is more features coming in leveling up the castle. Let me spend a few weeks building 1.5 million gold and the next unlock will be for 2 more additional heroes instead of just 1. \\" no chance at that. Slow goes the boat. Disappointing","This game appears to be quite simple, but as you level up, more and more features unlock. I think a number of other reviewers would have benefited from being able to see what unlocks with levels. The castle is a game changer as well. It would be nice for all the random tips to be listed somewhere, like a hero might buy a different staff than listed. That\'s a big deal for quests, but not obvious unless you\'re watching closely.","My only complaint so far is that I can\'t find, or there isn\'t, a button to instantly swap between buildings. Update (1/21/20): No other issues so far. Occasionally they\'ll have some really sweet deals if you take some time to understand the value of each piece of the game. Absolutely ZERO popup ads which is always wonderful. Very easy to play, and restricting enough to keep you from playing TOO much in a day since it\'s very easy to lose track of time playing it, lol. Great game, never deleting.","The game is decently fun with an interesting storyline, however, the lack of shop variety is kind of disheartening. Everything takes quite a fair amount of gold to level up as well. It feels grind-y. I do love the art style and the game itself does not pretend to be anything other than what it really is I would like to suggest adding Champions that require goods/monsters/treasures to be a specific level for them to visit. Give us some goals other than quests, please. It would be appreciated."],"appId":"com.FunFlavorGames.HeroPark","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.FunFlavorGames.HeroPark&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.tiedan.game.EdgeOfDoom":{"title":"Edge of Doom: Zombie Crisis","description":"Story background: After a terrible Resident Evil broke out, the world became a wasteland.

","comments":["There are way too many ads, I watch an ad then when I\'m opening a box 10 seconds later there\'s an ad. There\'s also noway to increase energy as far as I know. 50 is too low because some of the levels have a lot of 2 or 3 hit block things. The rest of the game is good, being able to customize the museum is a good Quality of Life addition.","So first let me turn off saying this is a fun idle game. I enjoy digging up the fossils and a sense of Mystery behind it because you never know what you find. It\'s not hard to understand how to play the game, the music is nice and the features such as poses and skins make for a nice touch. However, I have a hard time using the map, if you can. The only way I know how is by leveling up and because of this I recently ran into a glitch where I\'m leveling up faster than normal and skipping dig sites","Overall this is a good game I like digging for dinosaur fossils and putting them in a museum. And you can change the poses and add skins to the dinosaur skeletons (I mostly use the skins to hide the incomplete dinosaur skeletons). But I can\'t find the bones that I want. For instance, I can\'t find the archaeopteryx head and arm at 3 star quality. Please fix.","This is a very fun game. I enjoy getting all the dino bones..... However, my game started crashing randomly a week ago. No biggie as it\'s still a work in progress. Except now it can do anything without it crashing. Go to dig - crash, go to lab - crash, just open the game - crash. Will give a 5 star as soon as fixed.","I love the game, the digging, the graphics, all the little things you can do, etc. However a horrible bug that should\'ve been fixed long ago is the ads. You have the choice to watch them when you run out of moves and a lot of times it won\'t give you rewards after you watch them. It\'s extremely annoying. Would be 5 stars if not for this huge issue"],"appId":"com.tapps.games.dig.dinoquest2","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tapps.games.dig.dinoquest2&hl=en&gl=us"},"online.limitless.appleknight.free":{"title":"Apple Knight: Action Platformer","description":"Apple Knight is a modern action platformer with precise touch controls, fluid movement, and smooth animation.

The ads aren\'t intrusive, they give you one if they die after a long time In the game and everytime you complete a lvl. The problem is that the game doesn\'t save until AFTER the add. I complete a lvl and if I accidentally click an add and it takes me away from the game, I click back in and progress lost and if an add waits a full minute till the x shows and you go out and back in, redo the lvl :/","Fantastic platformer! There are several worlds, each with it\'s own environment and series of levels. Each world has it\'s own feel about it all while leading to a big boss at the end. You gain loot so you can buy new weapons, skins and some abilities to customize your hero. When you get to that point where your hero is unstoppable there is the ultra hard mode where one mistake will stop your run, so speed runners and cassual players can get their preferred experience. Excellent job team!","Great time killer, the controls are easy to use, great graphics and gameplay. I would rate it 5 stars if it weren\'t for the add glitch where the x button takes a long time to pop up and my progress would be lost, but other than that Great game, If you\'re bored this game is what I recommend playing.","This game is lots of fun with options for gamers of all levels. It\'s a platformer, so the controls really need to be very tight (i.e., precise), and the developers did a solid job with that. Plus, it has controller support(!), which takes it to another level for me because of the tactile experience of buttons. The game is free with ads, but the number of ads isn\'t too overwhelming, and you get quite a bit of rewards for watching, especially if you do so voluntarily. Overall, a great experience.","Game\'s got it all. Great sidescrolling platformer, controller compatible, HIGHLY recommended!! You don\'t have to watch ads, unless you choose to, and any in game purchase, even just .99\xa2 removes adds. As for in game purchases, most of them can be bought with either real money, or coins from the level, making relatively few items behind a pay wall. Ads, and micro-transactions are by choice only, and not necessary. So it\'s not only a GREAT platformer, but really considerate of players!

Used to play pretty regularly, and would even willingly watch an ad now and again, but now they don\'t give me a choice; there are ad pop-ups with no button to close except the one to watch the ad. It\'s unfortunate. Ever since DECA took over, the player experience has really suffered. Changes are made that clearly make watching ads the only really way to progress or play the game. Save yourself the heartache and move on.","So I like the game but it\'s now broken because I cannot progress at all. Every time I reopen the app to try and progress, the aeon gates is stuck and I cannot abandon the gate even though the timers at zero and my other gates just keep resetting to the last time I open the game. I\'m trying to force update the game and see if that fixes it. If not then I\'m just going to uninstall and not bother with it. Problem has been fixed with an update.","Great gameplay with steady sense of progression. Each of the heroes can be upgraded in multiple useful ways. The menus are clear and easy to use. There is NO paywall that prevents enjoyment once you reach a certain point, though there are cosmetics and boosters you can buy if you want to. The art style is humorous, colorful, and clear. The devs are also steadily improving and adding features to make it interesting for both new players and veterans. A fun clicker game with meaningful choices.","I love this game a lot, and have easily spent a few hours in the past week upgrading various characters and unlocking as much stuff as possible. I\'ve been able to upgrade every character to Epic so far except for Lia. For whatever reason, the game crashes every time I attempt to upgrade her, and as a result, she\'s still stuck at the Common level. I\'ve sent the error reports, as requested, but nothing has come of it. I just want to be able to use Lia, but she is too low-level now to be effective.","This game was great. I literally played it every day and have played it for so long. However they recently updated where if you lose on a boss you are automatically sent back levels. This means even when not playing and you lose you will go back. Very frustrating to get so far and then not be able to sit there and not play the boss to earn upgrades. unfortunately after being very dedicated and playing a lot. I\'m going to have to uninstall."],"appId":"com.beesquare.almostahero","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.beesquare.almostahero&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.RetrostyleGames.LastPirate.deadthieves":{"title":"Last Pirate: Survival Island Adventure","description":"Survival and Pirates in free pirate adventure simulator!\\n\\nYour survival started on the lost island.

This is 100% better than the other raft/survival game. The game has tons of content, better graphics, and it\'s not stingy with items. Controlling movement, targeting, and building UI can be tough..but thats common with all mobile/tablet apps. This is a 5-star game regardless of the platform. ---edit--My inventory just vanished. Please restore my items. I do not want to craft all my items again...and several stacks of other materials.","I don\'t like that it erases your entire inventory of items every time you die. Even of things you\'ve already built. It\'s pretty impossible to get a good thing going if you have to start from scratch every time (and be forced to go reclaim your \\"lost\\" items wherever you died, starting from the origin point on the island to boot!) Not a great game for me. Would be otherwise.","It\'s a fun game. A question for the developers: am I supposed to be able to upgrade my boat house past level 3? The paper by the entrance lights up but there are no options like before. I\'m not sure if it\'s a glitch or that\'s all I can do Edit: there hasn\'t been any response from the developer. This game is full of loads of glitches. After grinding forever to get into the dungeon, the results were super underwhelming, and there was really nothing left to do. There\'s also a church for no reason.","Love the game in general. However one thing that would help out some is more of a tutorial in game. Or shorts scripts for items. There isn\'t much to find on internet about it. For instance what is the green bottle with red dot that appeares on the screen randomly. One other thing that may hold interest longer is to possibly have more to explore. Maybe different areas after different levels. A way of panning out would be good too, some areas are just to close up, especially in bushy areas.","Overall happy, a few minor things. When I upgraded from camp 2 to 3 the second floor changed height. So the chests I put up there went through the floor and now hang on the ceiling. Not an issue as I can still access but disappointing, the loom also went partially through the floor. It seems like there should be a level 4 as the stats weren\'t maxing and the paper still glows blue but I can\'t interact with it anymore."],"appId":"com.RetrostyleGames.LastPirate.deadthieves","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.RetrostyleGames.LastPirate.deadthieves&hl=en&gl=us"},"jp.oridio.museum":{"title":"TAP!

Ads are uncommon and short. Money might be tight in the beginning but you\'ll soon be generating money faster than you can spend it. Any of the items bought with gems are single use and are a minor benefit at most, in other words, totally unnecessary. Its cute and fun and basically the perfect mobile game. Has everything you might want in a mobile game without any of the problems that other apps suffer from!","It\'s a fun little clicker to pass time, and they\'re right, I do enjoy trying to guess which dinosaur it is on every dig, lol. I\'m playing the Play Pass version, so there are no microtransactions or ads, which makes the experience a lot more enjoyable (gem purchases are free, just time-locked). Only downside is some mechanics aren\'t very well-explained, you just have to kind of figure them out through trial and observation. Not sure the point of all the tools, upgraded pickaxe handles everything.","Great game, but its way too repetitive, you\'ll keep digging until you complete a skeleton, then rinse and repeat. The only fun part is trying to guess the dinosaur before you complete it. Other than that its just a really simple and easy game that will make you addicted for a few days and will be boring after which leads to uninstalling the game.","This is in a top ranking class amongst very few mobile games. I\'m a total sucker for dinosaur stuff and this is fantastic I adore the look of the pixelart dino fossils, the gameplay is enjoyable being a mix of digging and museum design, the placement of ads is outstanding compared to some of these billboard trash heaps in the playstore and the choice to watch for a reward is great! The only gripe I have so far (I\'ve only gotten to F2 so far) is that the Dimorphodon skeleton is way too big.","VERY casual....NOT very idle...the museum doesn\'t attract customers when you are offline, so the offline progress is ONLY what you didn\'t pick up before leaving.... progress is something to be desired here.... Having to rerun the digs OVER FIFTY TIMES EACH for things that don\'t add to the process is probably the biggest downfall...no way to speed up the skeleton progress either....."],"appId":"jp.oridio.museum","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.oridio.museum&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.gm_shaber.dayr":{"title":"Day R Survival: Last Survivor","description":"In 1985, the USSR collapsed before an unknown enemy.

Let us know what you think of Day R Survival by leaving your review.","comments":["So addicting. Almost no ads. Only the ads make flashing screens. Easy on the eyes. No sexual content. I love the lack of explaination, or excessive story line. Just wake up in the thick of survival. Free to play. As challenging as you make it! I got my boat stranded in the ocean right away. I have to wait till next spring (in game) to retrieve it. I MUST GET GREEN HOUSE. Homestead is where the heart is.","I still remember when this game was in it\'s early stages, and how far it\'s come! A story line I can get behind and various challenges and companions you can meet in your journey keeps the game fresh and exciting! With this new combat system they have, has also added a bit of strategy in how you approach every battle! With the addition of villages you can now get materials and items you may have had trouble getting in the past! Def a must download if you love survival games,especially post apoc!","*Meanwhile in Russia* But seriously this is way better than other mobile survival games I\'ve played, not sure what exactly makes it better but it\'s definitely worth your time. It manages to outdo games that need 10x the storage space AND an internet connection. One thing that might improve this game is a chance to loot backpacks and things, I have a tendency to keep practically everything I find. Then again, I do that alot.","Good detailed game. Hard to play if in One Life mode. Update to post is it\'s a great game and better than any other. I have learned how to upgrade and use recipes for weapons, outfits, and to make iron and steel. Using easy premium mode from two years old account. Started playing two months ago and I am on level 89. I have been on life saving mode about ten times and I don\'t lose anything but that one level. Better game play and user interface on my android tablet is better than on my phone.","Edit: when the level system was added some time ago, I had just recently earned blacksmithing and had poured resources into it, but my progress was rolled back so I couldn\'t craft anything anymore without doubling my current character level. That was a huge bummer, still kind of sore about it too. But that aside still a good game and improving regularly. Maybe make some other ways to farm exp than just fighting and daily missions. It\'s not consistent enough."],"appId":"com.gm_shaber.dayr","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gm_shaber.dayr&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.dawinstone.b2be":{"title":"Bad 2 Bad: Extinction","description":"\u25c6 Caution\\nYour data will be reset if you change your device or delete the game.

The minigun makes you stand still and you die quickly because of it. Equipped weapons and gear shouldn\'t take up backpack space, because they\'re not in the backpack, they\'re equipped. There\'s a few errors in spelling and grammar as well. It doesn\'t tell you there\'s a chance to lose guns when combining them either.","This game is good, but there are a few things that can improve. There should be a way to reduce the effect/duration of stun and poison; there should be an option to revive with 5~10 dias next to the watch ad option; and there should be a cancel reload button. I\'ve been looking for a loot shooter that wasn\'t a one-handed roguelite, and this one works well. I especially enjoy the attachment system. Overall a good game, albeit flawed. Still recommend picking this up. No forced ads, which is a win!","Amazing 2D shooter game with a hint of 3D gameplay. The depth in attachments as well as equipment and bonuses from them is very balanced. The number of guns is sufficient along with the characters you can assign to your team. The flare is a great part of the game, Waves are there to give you resistance but calling in all the waves at once can end the resistance faster and can stack damage so the more enemies in line of fire, the more collective damage you can do with the same ammo. No complaints","This is a great game, it really is. It has a logical and likeable story line, the characters are cool, the wilders are an interesting kind of undead enemy and the enemies are awesome, the amount of guns and weapons system to the game is great and logical, same with the fighting system and the world map, but I just have a few complaints. Could you add different reloads to different guns such as a magazine removal and attachment animation for magazine fed guns? the reloads are a bit dull.","First of all, very good game. The gameplay is really fun and there aren\'t very many mobile games out there like this. But there are a few problems. First of all, it crashes alot. Mostly when I bring up a GUI or start a mission. I also have a complaint about the gorilla character. I love apes and monkeys but the gorilla looks horrible. I only wish that the eyes were a bit smaller and the chin was more defined (The nose Also juts out for some reason like a cliff edge (Also more primates please)"],"appId":"com.dawinstone.b2be","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dawinstone.b2be&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.superplusgames.oos":{"title":"Oceans of Steel","description":"Jump on board!

Ads are everywhere. You can\'t open certain things in the hud without an ad, can\'t leave a location without an ad, can\'t look at your inventory without an ad, and the microtrans prices are absolutely insane, $14 for a virtual car? $9 for a blinged pew pew that eventually you will have to replace. Great game, bad marketing.","I went from level 67 all the way down to level 23. Lost all of my gear and progress. Have repeatedly reached out to support but no response. Please fix for a higher rating. Stop your ads from killing people!!! When I am in the middle of a mission I click on my backpack and an ad pops up when it\'s done game crashes and sends you back to town at 20hp. Even if you have 150hp it will send you back. Very frustrating. The game would be great if it didn\'t crash so much(like every other ad)","So far the game is enjoyable. Controls are pretty good. The real downside so far is the ads for bonuses as well as to sell to the merchant for reasonable prices. I don\'t mind ads when they are used to keep the game free. However, I purchased the $5 no ads pack and still continue to receive ads. I have email their support and will update after I receive a reaponse","It\'s fun to play (when you can!). Between the overwhelming adds,and if something happens when you\'re in the middle of a task, you start out with very little life and losing everything you worked for. Would love to just play a game that they are not trying to constantly get you to buy stuff! I\'ll probably end up deleting this game a second time! Hard to enjoy and have fun when you\'re concentrating then you have to watch and skip an add...every other move! Very frustrating to say the least!!!!!\ud83e\udd2c","It\'s a really fun game, surprisingly detailed for a polygon game. But there are way to many ads! It\'s so frustrating trying to do stuff in the game cause there\'s an add every thirty seconds, or you have to watch an ad just to talk to someone or go in your backpack. This would be a 5 star game if it wasn\'t for the overwhelming number of unnecessary ads"],"appId":"com.aldagames.zombieshooter","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aldagames.zombieshooter&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.dreamgate.steampunktower2.android":{"title":"Steampunk Tower 2: The One Tower Defense Strategy","description":"Steampunk Tower 2 is a unique tower defense game for free set in the alternative Steampunk universe. \\n\\nThere is a dragged-out world war with the enemy never seen before.

During battles: when you upgrade a tower there is no indication of which towers are the strongest. You have to select each individual tower to see the stats. I also wish you could select for certain towers to ignore units, such as wasp only attacking air at certain times. At base: when upgrading units there is no indication about what the parts are doing. It\'s too easy to recycle upgrades, should have to confirm. Interface is a bit cluttered.","Fun game play and excellent graphics. Translation to English is mediocre. I\'ve currently been stuck with a game breaking bug where I can\'t tap any icons and I\'m stuck at the base view. I can\'t open any other screens, can\'t open the map, any buildings, or anything at all except the wheel spin minigame. Restarting my phone didn\'t fix and now I\'m totally unable to do anything.","Interesting game with simple mechanics and a slow pace (best to play no more than 20 min/day). It takes a real hit in playability, though, because mobile was made to have a very small view of the battlefield so when you get to mid game enemies are regularly shooting at you from off screen and you have to guess where they\'re at with your super shots. Watching PC replay vids it\'s also obvious the shortened field of view has made the bonus levels needlessly difficult. Overall it hurts the gameplay.","The concept is great however the game needs balancing. The resources of gold and etherium are to easy to get, however parts to upgrade the guns are way to hard to find. In addition, you have to have a certain experiance level to upgrade your buildings to move forward. However I have completed all of the side missions (which give experiance), and one only pops up every 8-12 hours. At this rate it could take me weeks to get to the next level. I cant even buy my way out! This is a true game flaw!","The gameplay, defending your tower, is pretty good. Moving turrets to the middle to quickly reload in-between waves is fun. Just one problem though, when you don\'t have enough fuel for a mission, you\'re (mostly) stuck waiting half an hour or more just to play the main part of the game. Never mind the long construction times, never mind that you have to spend premium credits just to use your super weapons after the first free use, I could\'ve given the game four stars if it weren\'t for the fuel mechanic."],"appId":"com.dreamgate.steampunktower2.android","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dreamgate.steampunktower2.android&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.datavisionstudio.roguelike":{"title":"Heroics Epic Legend of Archero","description":"Collect legendary weapons, level up your hero, choose new skills, and rip through legions of monsters!\\n\\nRun, shoot, explore, and become stronger.

Each game costs 1 key and you only get 3 keys lol! Each upgrade is random, and the good upgrades you will get literally once every 10 games lol! Some of the maps they intentionally make impossible to win on. The levels scale up ridiculously fast from easy to impossible in only one level. It\'s a joke how impossible they make it so you have to pay. If they would have made it playable, I\'d have paid for it...","An extremely fun game, map design could use some work. As a lot of times the hardest enemy seems like the terrain. My main gripe though is you cannot see ailments applied to your player. You can see it when applied to the enemies, so why not your playable character? That is my main reason for 4 not 5 stars. Overall fun game and anyone should give it a try.","I play a lot of these games and this one just makes me say \\"ok, I see what you did there.\\" the characters speed is just slightly to slow that you get hit by things you probably should be able to avoid. the enemies bullet speed is just slightly to fast and you\'ll get hit. You can\'t always tell when the enemy bullets will hit a wall or go over. it\'s things that makes me think they did it on purpose so you die and speed money on power ups. Which I understand they are a business and want to make money. it feels scummy tho. it\'s hard to describe but in a lot of other games, when you get hit or die, you feel like it was a fair death. in this game, I just die and don\'t quite know why. That can all be forgiven because I like a challenging game and I don\'t mind spending money, my biggest complaint is the amount of ads there are. for an example. you can watch 6 ads to get the 6 main resources for upgrades. they don\'t give you enough during the missions. it feels like playing 3 missions gives you as much at 1 ad. then they have \\"epic\\" chest that you can watch 6 ads and unlock 1 chest. even if you get a good item, you\'ll have to watch more ads to get the gold to craft it. but you\'re in luck, you can buy a pass for no ads.. for a week or 2 weeks or 1 month. no options for a 1 time buy. The ads are also difficult to close out of. sometimes they play for 1 min and no x will appears for another 10 -15 seconds. if you click anywhere on the screen it will take you to the google page. when you go back to the game, the x still wont show up sometimes. A few times I was unable to exit the ads and had to close out my game and I didn\'t get credit for watching. You\'ll spend more time watching ads than playing the game.","Developers deleted my review, so I will elaborate... The game itself is fun! But that fun is limited, as the ads are aggressive, by sometimes locking you into them and you\'re unable to leave the ad, which means you have to close the game and lose progress. The no-ad purchases are greedy and TIME LIMITED. I\'d happily pay a one time small purchase for no ads, but that should not have a time limit to it.","I really like it, so far. A perchase for no ads is very very helpful give you lots of free stuff and it\'s not expensive. But if you want you can watch lots of ads instead to get the same items. Ive played just one day and it\'s my top three favorite game. I hope \ud83e\udd1e it stays that way. Update: I\'ve been playing two weeks now. I still really like this game. I have confirmed that it is far better to remove the adds and support the developers with inexpensive purchases, free is a lot of ads to watch"],"appId":"com.datavisionstudio.roguelike","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.datavisionstudio.roguelike&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.ctugames.km2":{"title":"The Wild Darkness","description":"Inside a forest on a mysterious world...\\nA sorcerer is casting a spell in the dark.\\nOnce the ritual was complete, a streak of light fell from the sky.\\n\\nThen you regain consciousness in the middle of a strange forest.\\nWhere...

It is rather fun, I must say, even with its difficulty. Much to explore, much to discover. I recommend getting some extra cash, though, to at least be able to have 1 Revival Ahnk, and better remains. If not, well, good luck; you\'ll be needing every drop of it once you begin, trust me Sweetling.","I really really enjoy this game. But I have an issue when I save a game and reload it later. There seems to be something missing when I come back. I have had multiple bottles of water missing from my inventory and I have had my fire pit gone and I don\'t have enough stone to rebuild one making it very difficult. These aren\'t the only two instances of this happening, although it\'s not every time. I hope the creator sees this and takes a look into why this happens.","The Wild Darkness, is a very challenging survival game for the strong minded who is willing to sacrifice it all in order to defeat the all the bosses. You must survive Diseases, The elements, against curses and magics, Random game play, unique monsters; fantastic game with a great art style and game play. Warning: for those willing to play if you die then you will most certainly lose all your progress. It\'s all part of the hard frustrating-painful fun to achieve the unachievable.","This game is an incredible rogue like survival game. The difficulty in the beginning had a definitive curve that lessened with each play through. The 4\u2606 review would have been 5, but I feel the devs are catering to those that whine too much. Food was very scarce prior to the update, which made several totems and strategy paramount to survival. After the update, I seem to find food in every container & blade of grass. I admit to wishing food was easier to acquire; however, it is TOO easy now.","I really loved this game at first, amazing concept, cute animation and fun gameplay but when you die, you lose your whole game-save. I was super disappointed and unhappy about this, it\'s hard to survive in this game and having to lose all your progress after dieing once is very angering. I wish at least you would lose all your inventory items, or maybe have to die 3 times to lose your progress instead of this. I would have given a 5 star review if you didn\'t lose your progress when you die."],"appId":"com.ctugames.km2","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ctugames.km2&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.Kraken.TinyWorlds":{"title":"Tiny Worlds: Dragon Idle games","description":"Your main mission, if you\u2019re up to it?

A HUGE update is available with a new Event and a lot of changes! Here&#39;s the changelog:<br>- New Summer Event! Collect watermelons to unlock the Leviathans!<br>- New pet animations and VFX<br>- Pet passives reworked and pet levels capped at 10<br>- Big game rebalancing to suit the above change<br>- New Pet UI page and sort options<br>- Eggs are now also collected within the offline rewards<br>- Numerous quality of life changes<br>- Various bugfixes","comments":["The game is great. Its got great graphics, theme, gameplay and etc. But there are 2 complaints... 1: it takes WAY too long to level up... why do you need to wait 2 seconds until you go to next world? Fix this and it would make me very happy. 2: there are some ads that are a entire minute long!?!? And also sometimes it makes me rewatch an ad to get the reward... Other than that, its great! No forced ads, no popups asking for money though if I could I would donate (sry).","This game is super fun! I keep it open sometimes just to get the presents as they go past! And the collection of eggs is very fun! I do wish there was more things to do in here though. Like side quests that will cycle through after you complete each one versus daily quests or more runes to collect. The events are amazing but I wish they were more frequent and I\'d really like more things to collect besides pets! But otherwise I love everything about this game and excited for what\'s next!","A decent enough game. Honestly the only reason it\'s not a 5 star one is because some of the mechanics feel very unfair. It\'s really frustrating when you miss downing a boss level because you pets are coded to move every few seconds and you lose that dps as they fly to the other side of the cube. Also absolutely pay to win, but you can still make decent progress if you don\'t.","The game itself is fun for an idle game, and progression is fast. My biggest issue (and the reason for the rating) is that ads often have multiple layers, all of which have up to 30 second timers before they can be skipped and still get rewards. I\'ve had multiple ads I\'ve had to wait 2 or even 3 30-second timers for to skip, and even then I have to fight the pin-sized button to actually skip it and not just open the app store by accident.","This game has a good concept and is fun to play. It has fun art and is relatively simple. However, it can be a bit complicated to understand at first. The dragons are a fun concept but aren\'t really functional to the game, as you can move forward quicker if you don\'t upgrade them. Also, I wish there was a way that you didn\'t have to go all the way back go level 75 when you \\"reset\\" levels. Maybe if you\'re far enough ahead, go back to the closest 100 level? Just a thought.

If you\'re killing time and on a WiFi connection it\'s passable. I\'m changing my rating to 1 star. It\'s only playable if you have WiFi, you spend more time watching ads than actually playing, and once you start leveling you have to lose roughly 3-4 matches before winning 1, unless of course you want to pay to win.","wasn\'t what I thought it would be, but that doesn\'t mean it is t as great as it is. there\'s still a couple things wrong which will happen with any game, but I really like the clean layout and gameplay. first of all I think there needs to be more cards, which I think the game devs are working one second, which will be big, maybe add a 3d model for when the cards hit each other? third, make the buff for having the same kinds of cards together more powerful.","This is a good game. My only issues are that coins and upgrade cards seem to be few and far between as you move up the ranks. also the amount of coin it takes to upgrade from blue to purple is high at 1k. The last thing is that the battles are still somewhat automated even when not using auto battle. I wish i had more control over which of my cards attacks when.","so i think the game is super fun and i really think that yall have a solid base that can be fine tuned and improved to be a super fun game. i just wish some of the mechanics were a little more thought out like being able to organize your cards to be able to see which characters belong to which faction. or put them in order based on their attack or health. this would be a big improvement and start to make the game a little more competitive. also different multiplayer modes would be nice too.","I\'ve only been playing this a short time. For someone looking for an in depth tcg this is not really you. This game is basic atack/initiative/health, and then each card character has a combo skill you do not control. Despite this I still give it a solid 4 because its smooth running, f2p is a valid option, and even though its basic as far as a tcg, Im still able to enjoy it for what it is. I would recommend to a casual player."],"appId":"com.noxgames.shadow.deck.card.ccg","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.noxgames.shadow.deck.card.ccg&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.pixelbite.ga2":{"title":"Reckless Getaway 2","description":"It ain\u2019t no cakewalk topping the most-wanted list.

I like the destructive aspect of it and it works well to let some steam off. The only thing I would like to see is more ways to spend the coins. Thanks to Google PlayPass, I have unlocked 95%of the vehicles so I really have no use for the coins now. It would be nice if we could buy powerups with the coins that you normally get from getting the purple question marks when playing the game. Overall fun game though.","this game has so much potential. i love the graphics, the driving is amazing, and all the vehicles are detailed in a way so you know what there are, one problem is the missions for each vehicle, and with that some of them are just way too tricky or can be impoosible. It can really cause players stress. other than that, there is nothing wrong with this game. Great job Dev.-Lil19","This is my 100% honest review, and I must start by saying I really do love this game a lot. The controls are nice, I like the auto gas idea as it adds to the challenge, I like the different vehicles you can get and the maps are cool, especially the farm. Ive completed nearly every challenge decently well and with practice... Except the flaming bike... Thats too hard imo. My one main issue is the car buying system... Did 50 draws and got zero new cars... So much time wasted. Overall good game!","Very fun. 84 different cars to collect, ranging from combine harvesters to sedans, this game has literally everything. Very easy to control, the maps are really well put together and the cars chasing you are really interesting, like cop cars and SWAT vehicles, tanks and hummers. You can collect power-ups, one is an explosion that knocks back every car around you, one is a mode where you are invincible and break everything you hit, and the last is jump boost. There are challenges, too.","Excellent concept with great potential. I love the run from the police concept, but I am disappointed about the upgrades, levels, achievements as they do not enhance gameplay. The controls are pretty painful and cumbersome. Your car will damage quickly and wreck within the first minute. Get different a different car doesn\'t help! None of the cars stay straight despite the type of cars that you can easily get because the coins are given so freely.

With plenty of content to boot with no predatory microtransactions. Why the low rating? The controls are horribly placed and lack configuration. It\'s genuinely hard to input the right key they\'re so tiny. With the ability to reconfigure and rescale controls, this game would be 5*/5*","Space Marshals 3 is an awesome game! I\'m a huge fan of the previous two Space Marshals games. The game seems to run better after Chapter 3 was released. In some parts, the game runs smooth at the highest graphics settings, but still suffers from reduced frame rate when the level is larger and more populated, even on high-end devices. Still, this did not deter me from playing. In my opinion, Space Marshals games are the best games on Google Play. They are fun, captivating, and have a great story.","I was super hyped for Space Marshals 3. I made it through Chapter 2 and had been waiting in the release of the next install for months. While I like the continuous nature of the story, I was disappointed that I went through Ch 3 so quickly. The challenges got more intense towards the end but bummed I beat the game & there isn\'t anything else to do in it. I hope there is a Space Marshals 4 coming. I haven\'t found a game that comes close to this one.","The game is so slow and glitchy that it\'s unplayable. I had it on my old phone back before part 3 came out and it worked well, an awesome game it was. Now, on my new phone, it\'s just so buggy and glitchy and slow that even if you spend the 20 minutes to get the first level to start, you can\'t do anything because it doesn\'t register your commands and then the game crashes. Pity, I did love the game.","I know that Space Marshals 1 was a premium game, and 2 had the premium upgrade for more checkpoints and exclusive unlockables... But I was really expecting more than 2 levels. You get to play the tutorial + level 1, then the rest of the game is $8 and an extra $3 for bonus bounty hunts. I would have rather been told to pay $8 up front, then had the option for the $3 expansion. I believe that first level doesn\'t give enough time for someone to decide if they enjoy the game."],"appId":"com.pixelbite.sm3","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pixelbite.sm3&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.biglime.cookingmadness":{"title":"Cooking Madness -A Chef\'s Game","description":"PREPARE \ud83d\udd2a, COOK \ud83d\udd51and SERVE \ud83c\udf55 delicious meals from all over the world \ud83c\udf0e in Cooking Madness! \\n \\nBecome the master chef \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udf73 you have always wanted to be!

I\'m over 100 levels in and I can no longer say this isn\'t a pay-to-win game, which is a shame bc it IS very fun. I absolutely HAVE to buy \ud83d\udc8e in order to advance bc I\'ll be a mere 2 coins or 4 likes away from a goal after playing the same level several times. I have so many coins now I REALLY wish you could spend them on anything other than restaurant upgrades. You should be able to buy a booster with them at the very least. It takes way too long to earn \ud83d\udc8e","Easy and fun, not too difficult or stressful. All the ads weren\'t annoying until I paid to get them removed and still get ads to get double coins, mysterious gifts, etc which why am I paying to remove ads, but I still have to play ads to get bonuses or to instant upgrade my stuff? Definitely not a fan of that. If someone is paying to remove ads, then remove all ads \ud83d\ude44","This game is surprisingly decent for a free to play game, with the stipulation that you pay $1 to get rid of the ads. There is an energy system but your energy only depletes if you fail a level, and that\'s not super common. Some levels are hard and can take multiple attempts, but there are also ways to get infinite energy for a set duration of time. After playing 260 levels on this game, I have a lot of premium in-game currency as well, so I could buy help if I needed it.","The game is fun, nice design and graphics. However the flaws, so many ads it\'s insanity. I get it being free and the ads are what makes it that way but after everytime I finish a round and then if I want double coins I have to watch another one. Way to much! Secondly once you finish a restraunt level and make it 3 stars you can\'t even go back in and play it to make some extra coins for upgrades, or just practice to get better ext. May get deleted due to ads being to much.","Only giving 1 star because, The characters are to slow to come kn screen for timed boards. The levels become expensive and impossible. If you have epilepsy DO NOT play this. You have to go so fast at the higher levels it is rough especially the timed at the highest levels of the level. Ad free for 1.00 is great however it is very hard to continue"],"appId":"com.biglime.cookingmadness","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.biglime.cookingmadness&hl=en&gl=us"}}');var c=o(2734),d=o(7357),u=o(5861),g=o(6886),m=o(6242),p=o(3965),y=o(4267),f=o(5113),b=o(4410),w=o(9960);const v=l;function k(){(0,c.Z)();return a.createElement("section",{className:i},a.createElement("div",{className:"container"},a.createElement("div",{className:"row"},a.createElement(d.Z,null,a.createElement(u.Z,null,"Anything missing?
