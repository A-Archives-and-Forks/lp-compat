There are numerous moments in-game where your assistant manager pitches in with advice which can help. The complexity does impede on gameplay too much for me but worth a try if you\'re a fan of this type of management in your football games. After giving it a go am sticking with NSS as there is just way too much to deal with here.","I never leave in actual worded review on anything but I have been playing this game for quite a while now and it\'s amazing. To anyone saying you need to buy cards to keep up, I just beat Champ league brentford while still in league2 with a 35 avg team. It\'s not easy by any means, but its possible. Like any team game, just know who your Strikers are, make sure every player gets at least some playing time, and pick and choose who gets training and when. Great game overall!","The game is extremely fun. The amount of stuff you have to take into account can be overwhelming, but it\'s a good challenge. The game play is good as well. Dribbling is kind of awkward because you have to pull back but then it\'s hard to stop and pass without going into shooting mode and hitting cancel. Progress through the bottom league is good, but the moment you get promoted your toast. You have to buy players because you\'ll barely get any scoring attempts in the second leave with you mid 30/low 40 players. You loss and everyone will be unhappy. I\'d be willing to buy a pack, but the 1, 2, or 3 players you\'d get for $10 will not make a difference with the rest of your squad being so low and not having any depth.","Good game, ruined by need to buy cards. Been playing nss for years and played this one now and then. The gameplay itself is great and hard to put down when you get into it. However, I am sick of losing by 1 goal no matter how many I get and all concern bars filling up, leading to poor play and losing key players after a few seasons. The entire experience and team frustratingly falls apart after a few good days play and is basically a waste of time.","Honestly great game but it still has its flaws. One is that you can\'t bend the ball nearly as well as you could in new star soccer. This makes it nearly impossible to hit free kicks and honestly this causes free kicks to put you in a worse situation. It piles defenders into the box and with no way to shoot you have to pass and hope you can get a scoring opportunity with 7 defenders in the box. But besides this and having to tank the second season because you aren\'t anywhere near good enough to be where you get promoted to this game is great."],"appId":"uk.fiveaces.nsfc","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.fiveaces.nsfc&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.pixelbite.xwt":{"title":"Xenowerk Tactics","description":"Play the first part for free.

Sometimes when I DoubleClick a spot one of my ops will get stuck somewhere... Also different environments in the woods when we have to engage and kill monsters... I don\'t like the auto-shooting... Maybe you guys could have an option to turn it on/off?? Game looks really good! No lag or crashes ... I have my game settings on high and it\'s doing amazingly! \ud83d\ude0a one more thing, could you add a normal mode? Only easy & hard available atm...","Games actually disappointing. I got interested in this game due to another game they produced, Space Marshals 2. That, absolutely love so let\'s see what else they got. The mix of old school 80s animation and computer graphics, does NOT work here. Plus random events via cards, it should simply happen and not be a card draw situation. A better way to have a functional tutorial and yet be a \\"make sense,\\" in game flow: have people in the team do backstory missions. You see their abilities.","Enjoying and engaging gameplay. You gear and deploy a 3 man squad (maybe more later in game?) The squad members gain random useful traits/mutations as they level up. Many of these are very cool to use. In a more expensive game I would ask for more classes and maybe branching weapon selections for the squad to add more strategy but as it is, its a great experience for the price. I also am a fan of using the cards to showcase most of the information as they do most of the time here.","I paid for it after the demo period thinking there would be more substance, but there isn\'t. I find that there are too few enemies and too few abilities to really change things. It has a gameplay loop similar to XCOM with combat being more fast-paced. Easy was a bit of a mindless slog. Turned it up to Hard (there is no Normal), and the randomized abilities cause a lot of early game forced losses as it becomes too easy to be overwhelmed and you don\'t have any abilities to do anything about it.","The game was overall pretty fun but the pathfinding was very wonky at times. Also the final mission was a bit annoying as if you made the factory on the last day you still lost the game. It wouldve been nice to have a checkpoint to go back to so I could finish the mission sooner, or at least have clearer instructions instead of having to restart the whole game to get the ending. Otherwise it was pretty nice."],"appId":"com.pixelbite.xwt","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pixelbite.xwt&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.pixelbite.mutant":{"title":"Xenowerk","description":"Be the last hope against the mutant infestation.

It has micro-transactions (which I despise) but they were done correctly and not at all a nuisance. The gameplay loop is a solid, pick up and play for a few minutes one. The only reason I give it 4 stars is that all the levels are essentially visually the same. They\'re detailed and look good though, so it\'s only a minor complaint, frankly.","It\'s a great game, well it has potential to be great, 1. Missions need to be more hands, longer, and have better adjectives. 2. You should be able to buy (or earn) teammates to aid you. 3. It\'s currently boring how easy the enemies are to kill plus there\'s not many of them. 4. Just add some stuff like sas 3 did, well good luck with the game and keep at it.","Pretty awesome. A twin stick shooter with equipment upgrades. It works out of the box with my USB-C controller, and I couldn\'t be happier. It feels like a proper top-down action RPG, bit you can literally pick it up and clear a level with only five minutes to spare. Easy to pick up, have a minute of fun, and quit. Haven\'t even seen a single ad. This is not your usual Android store garbage.","The first time a free game wasn\'t shooting ads in my face every 10 seconds. Gameplay is reminiscent of Alien Swarm. It doesn\'t hold your hand, you might actually have to use your brain to pathfind through a level. The difficulty is fair, all around, looks like the kind of game that\'s worth someone\'s time. Makes me want to actually support the dev.","I enjoy this game. Graphics, game play, items/weapons leveling by experience gained from defeated aliens all well done. Only area I would immediately improve is what I can see while I\'m playing. For example, the camera is close down to the level, which I like especially the destructible environment and details like writing on walls, desks, etc. However, sometimes when moving backwards away from the enemies, shooting at them, they\'ll be off the screen, can\'t see what I\'m aiming at."],"appId":"com.pixelbite.mutant","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pixelbite.mutant&hl=en&gl=us"}}');var h=o(2734),p=o(6886),m=o(6242),u=o(4267),d=o(5113),g=o(7357),y=o(5861),b=o(4410);function f(){(0,h.Z)();return a.createElement("section",{className:i},a.createElement("div",{className:"container"},a.createElement("div",{className:"row"},a.createElement(p.ZP,{container:!0},Object.entries(l).map((e=>{let[t,o]=e;return a.createElement(w,{appId:t,key:t})}))))))}const w=e=>{let{appId:t}=e;const o=(0,h.Z)(),{iap:n}=l[t],{title:s,icon:r,installs:i,scoreText:f}=c[t],w=n?o.palette.success.main:o.palette.error.main,v=n?"IAP patch works!":"IAP incompatible";return a.createElement(p.ZP,{item:!0,margin:1},a.createElement(m.Z,null,a.createElement(u.Z,null,a.createElement(d.Z,{component:g.Z,elevation:0,padding:.5,sx:{backgroundColor:w}},a.createElement(y.Z,{color:o.palette.getContrastText(w)},v)),a.createElement(g.Z,{display:"flex"},a.createElement(b.Z,{src:r,variant:"square"}),a.createElement(g.Z,{display:"flex",flexDirection:"column"},a.createElement(y.Z,{variant:"subtitle2"},s),a.createElement(y.Z,{variant:"subtitle2"},t))),a.createElement(g.Z,{display:"flex",justifyContent:"space-between"},a.createElement(y.Z,null,"\u2b50",f),a.createElement(y.Z,null,"\ud83d\udce9 ",i)))))},v="heroBanner_qdFl";function k(){const{siteConfig:e}=(0,s.Z)();return a.createElement("header",{className:(0,n.Z)("hero hero--primary",v)},a.createElement("div",{className:"container"},a.createElement("h1",{className:"hero__title"},e.title),a.createElement("p",{className:"hero__subtitle"},e.tagline)))}function A(){const{siteConfig:e}=(0,s.Z)();return a.createElement(r.Z,{title:"Hello from "+e.title,description:"Description will go into a meta tag in <head />"},a.createElement(k,null),a.createElement("main",null,a.createElement(f,null)))}}}]);
