The last couple months tho have been upsetting because the game would often glitch and crash resulting in stuff I earned to not be there next I open the app. I updated it recently and it was smooth sailing for a week and now it\'s starting to crash again.","Disclaimer that I played this game to receive rewards in a different game. It was fun, and I was able to acquire 100 dragons within the time limit in order to receive all rewards. Overall totally recommend this game (rewards or not). I especially like the levels and other side games, where other merge games only have the \\"camp\\" aspect. What I don\'t like is the graphics aren\'t that great, and when collecting items it usually puts them in random places rather than near similar ones.","I really enjoy this game... It\'s something I do while I listen to audiobooks \ud83d\ude05 I DO wish we had the options of having an inventory of special/hard to achieve items without cluttering our land or having to sell the item off.i feel like that would be an awesome improvement. The game makers have always been very responsive to my issues I\'ve had over the years I\'ve been playing (at least 3 significant problems arose that they fixed for me).","I really liked this game a while back but had to stop. I came back after a long hiatus and still enjoy it. One problem that was not remedied by the latest fix is the saves. Not only is my previous game not saved, but errors in coins and bricks in my little vaults are showing up as well. I spend the coins and bricks, but what I purchased has mysteriously vanished from my previous game. Not cool.","I sporadically play. I\'ve noticed since this most recent update that merge chains are overly sensitive to trigger when I don\'t want them to (pulls items that are diagonal and not directly in contact for example). I\'ve also noticed that there is a lot more lag both in my camp and in level... but a LOT more during levels. These two issues are so frustrating that it impacts my ability to enjoy it."],"appId":"com.gramgames.mergedragons","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gramgames.mergedragons&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.turner.pocketmorties":{"title":"Rick and Morty: Pocket Mortys","description":"The #1 multi-dimensional grandson fighting simulator in the galaxy is back and better than ever!\\n\\nYou\u2019re Rick Sanchez, everyone\u2019s favorite unstable genius.

I have uninstalled and reinstalled three times already and I\'m still stuck on the loading screen and all it says is error it won\'t even let me start the game. At first it wasn\'t too big of an issue I had my highest level Morty was 21 so I haven\'t spent too much time in the game but still I\'ve been playing for a while and I had quite a few more of these captured like for ethics a lot of exotics a couple of rares and a lot of commons.","re-downloaded the game to get back into it, I missed the gameplay, it makes me feel nostalgic, and I enjoy it a lot. So, I think it\'s missing a key feature that would bring so many more competitive players to the game. The game relies on a 1v1 battle style, but can\'t it add so much more complex opportunities with a 2v2 setting? A rock type vs a scissors type shows a clear advantage, but add paper to scissors team, and another rock type with rock, and it becomes much more challenging! -S22 ultra","I loved the game 100% BUT I had to redownload it when I got a new phone and it won\'t let me choose either if the saved progresses it\'s found for me. When I press one of the saved progresses, it loads for a sec then goes back to the saved progress screen. I\'ve tried both and neither one works and I can\'t get into the game to reset. If the developers could fix so that I can log back in or reset for me, I\'ll start playing again.","Constant freezing & crashes. Doesn\'t matter if it\'s campaign or multiplayer mode, the end result is the same: GAME OVER. Super disappointing & no fix in sight. Why bother with it anymore? About to put this one back on the shelf. Last update was more than a month ago, it\'s like the developers don\'t care. Numerous unaddressed bugs. I\'m on a Samsung S21+ with latest system updates, as well as latest app version. Can\'t believe the app performs so poorly on a device with such great hardware.","Great game when it works. Recently it has this crashing bug in Android. If you try to open the game, especially multiplayer, it just crashes and closes out. Last time I fixed it by uninstalling and then reinstalling, but it\'s happening again. I really hope they can fix this since it\'s super inconvenient to keep uninstalling."],"appId":"com.turner.pocketmorties","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.turner.pocketmorties&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.ludia.dragons":{"title":"Dragons: Rise of Berk","description":"Build your OWN Berk!

Without the fancy dragon rider\'s pass it can take a bit of time to advance but it\'s still possible which is nice! That said it\'s a little disappointing that so many features are only for dragon riders because I\'ve played for so long (I remember back when the original character huts were added) so I wish that the og players could get some kind of bonus without paying a ton but otherwise it\'s definitely a game worth getting. :)","So far it\'s a pleasant enough experience. There\'s a nice variety of dragons, you can name them, etc. My main complaint is that the game crashes pretty frequently. Not sure if anyone else has this problem, but I\'m lucky if a single session lasts longer than 5 minutes. UPDATE: game now crashes completely, deleting other apps and clearing my cache doesn\'t work. I really want to play this game, but it just refuses to work.","This game is probably my favorite out of all my other games. It has high quality and outstanding graphics. There is always something to do while your waiting for something like, Brawling, defending berk, ect... Also there\'s varieties of dragons to unlock and it never forces you to watch ads. It sometimes crashes but aside from that, great game. \ud83d\udc4d","Dragons: Rise of Berk is a very slow, very grindy game. I\'ve been playing for 2 years and only unlocked 1 out of 10 legendary dragons. If you can get past that, there are some really great things to this game. The detail in the dragons and the island is great, and there is always something to work towards. My favorite part is that this game is purchase oriented, not ad oriented. It will never force you to watch an ad, though it does have a number of pop-ups and alerts for buying passes or packs.","I genuinely love this game so much, the designs are great, the dragons themselves are even better, and I just can\'t wait to see more! However, I recently experienced a bug that didnt allow me to play the game for about 15 seconds, every time I touched the screen, the Dragon Riders subscription thing would pop up. I am not at all trying to say that the devs are forcing people to buy it, and I am 100% sure its just a bug, but it could use some patching :]"],"appId":"com.ludia.dragons","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ludia.dragons&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.ludia.jurassicworld":{"title":"Jurassic World\u2122: The Game","description":"Return to Isla Nublar with the creators of the smash hit Jurassic Park\u2122 Builder for your next adventure: Jurassic World\u2122: The Game, the official mobile game based on this summer\u2019s epic action-adventure.

The visuals are very nice. Plenty to do from mission completion, to battles, decorating and etc. Game lags here and there but not too much. My issue are the crashes. The game crashes every time I play. Sometimes as soon as it loads into the game it\'ll crash. It\'s crashed 5 times back to back as soon as it loaded, on the 6th try I finally got to play. This game is really nice, and I don\'t plan to stop because of the crashing. It\'s just annoying, but hopefully can be fixed!","The game is really cool and fun to play. However it crashes way to much, mostly when in battles. Once you get to higher level and unlock more park expansion(which should cost coins) it doesn\'t work and makes you use the cash(dollars). Please fix the game. Its great! Would give 5 stars if it didn\'t crash so much.","Love game but getting frustrated. Now can only use dino cash to buy land expansion. It gets where only way to finish task you have spend a lot of money. I have bought passes and etc. But I can\'t always. I have lost battles from glitches . No other games I play does this. So it not my connection. Try reaching out for support and no response of yet. My screen is sometimes blacked out and land expansion shows no cost . If I am able to get it ,I need 200 in dino bucks. Please fix the bugs in game!!!","Constant crashes sometimes at random but they typically occur upon trying to load the game are after watching an ad, also unrelated but I don\'t like how theve locked everything behind \\"special events\\" or pay walls, you used to be able to get most dinosaurs via progression in the battle arena but that doesn\'t seem to be the case anymore. Either way though that\'s been my experience with this game","Will I love the game but for some reason now it crashes every time it opens. So it\'s getting 2 star. I\'ll make it 5 when it stops crashing every 5 seconds into the game. Great visuals, great play time, not long wait periods, and not to many ads unless you want to watch them to speed up or something."],"appId":"com.ludia.jurassicworld","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ludia.jurassicworld&hl=en&gl=us"},"grid.crawler.free.offline.rpg.games.dungeon.ward":{"title":"Dungeon Ward - rpg offline","description":"Action RPG mixed with grid-based Dungeon CrawlerDungeon Ward belongs to a genre of a single player action rpg offline games but it is mixed with old-school grid-based dungeon crawler(gridder) innovated by a modern 3rd person perspective.

This is not a money hungry developer trying to milk every cent he can, there is a single, optional AD at the end of each level, and you are rewarded for dealing with it with extra gold. Gameplay is good, controls take some getting used to, i use the 2nd joystick, rpg elements are a little lacking, and could be improved, the story could use some work. Overall, great game, worth the download, and kudos to the dev for taking the time to do this. 10/10","Beautiful and detailed backgrounds and character look (although no character customization available)! Very decent combat mechanics and skill combos. Too bad the Dev doesn\'t have more time to spend on this game, it could be really amazing. While fun as it is, it\'s very short and very simple: no real RPG elements, nothing really to explore or solve, no side quests, and a decent but very linear and short story line that drives each mission. Great ad video placement/player\'s opt in choice to watch!","I LOVE the nostalgia aspect of it. it\'s a call back to the old days of dungeon crawling!! sorely needed in this day and age of over the top advertisement. this is a sleeper. dangerously subdued, but if you like the old style of dungeon crawling, this is the one for you. in game ads are minimal. what\'s more, it\'s one person doing all of it. definitely check this out. I love it.","I think this game is really good, especially being developed single-handedly,( just like the MoonShades game on Google). I would like to eventually see more interaction with objects in the dungeon. For instance, the static crates and such, maybe a few random gold pieces in a few here and there to give those objects more purpose then that. Otherwise everything is pretty solid quests, quest rewards ( whichseem to be tailored to be class defined...thankfully),graphics, story, simplicity in gaming.","Pretty decent simple rpg. Classes could be a little more advanced and no wizard yet but overall it\'s satisfying if you like simple hack and slash. Weapon skills tree could be more unique. Seems like they are all the same nowadays. It\'s always learn a skill, then increase it up or maybe you want another one but it\'s always a slow process and kinda stupid. Something more unique and interesting would be nice. Maybe harder to achieve skills but more rewarding."],"appId":"grid.crawler.free.offline.rpg.games.dungeon.ward","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=grid.crawler.free.offline.rpg.games.dungeon.ward&hl=en&gl=us"},"uk.fiveaces.nsfc":{"title":"New Star Manager","description":"*** The #1 game in AppSpy.com\'s Top 10 of 2018! ***\\n\\nWelcome to New Star Manager: The critically acclaimed game from Simon Read, creator of the BAFTA Award-winning New Star Soccer series.\\n\\nTake control of New Star FC \u2013 a beleaguered soccer club which needs your management skills and instincts to unlock the team\'s potential and make it to the top of the game.\\n\\n   \u201cIf you love football\u2026you\u2019d be mad not to download it\u201d The\xa0Guardian\\n\\nThis is soccer management like you\'ve never experienced it - Be more than just a player, be the head, the heart, and backbone of New Star FC.

There are numerous moments in-game where your assistant manager pitches in with advice which can help. The complexity does impede on gameplay too much for me but worth a try if you\'re a fan of this type of management in your football games. After giving it a go am sticking with NSS as there is just way too much to deal with here.","I never leave in actual worded review on anything but I have been playing this game for quite a while now and it\'s amazing. To anyone saying you need to buy cards to keep up, I just beat Champ league brentford while still in league2 with a 35 avg team. It\'s not easy by any means, but its possible. Like any team game, just know who your Strikers are, make sure every player gets at least some playing time, and pick and choose who gets training and when. Great game overall!","The game is extremely fun. The amount of stuff you have to take into account can be overwhelming, but it\'s a good challenge. The game play is good as well. Dribbling is kind of awkward because you have to pull back but then it\'s hard to stop and pass without going into shooting mode and hitting cancel. Progress through the bottom league is good, but the moment you get promoted your toast. You have to buy players because you\'ll barely get any scoring attempts in the second leave with you mid 30/low 40 players. You loss and everyone will be unhappy. I\'d be willing to buy a pack, but the 1, 2, or 3 players you\'d get for $10 will not make a difference with the rest of your squad being so low and not having any depth.","Good game, ruined by need to buy cards. Been playing nss for years and played this one now and then. The gameplay itself is great and hard to put down when you get into it. However, I am sick of losing by 1 goal no matter how many I get and all concern bars filling up, leading to poor play and losing key players after a few seasons. The entire experience and team frustratingly falls apart after a few good days play and is basically a waste of time.","Honestly great game but it still has its flaws. One is that you can\'t bend the ball nearly as well as you could in new star soccer. This makes it nearly impossible to hit free kicks and honestly this causes free kicks to put you in a worse situation. It piles defenders into the box and with no way to shoot you have to pass and hope you can get a scoring opportunity with 7 defenders in the box. But besides this and having to tank the second season because you aren\'t anywhere near good enough to be where you get promoted to this game is great."],"appId":"uk.fiveaces.nsfc","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.fiveaces.nsfc&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.pixelbite.xwt":{"title":"Xenowerk Tactics","description":"Play the first part for free.

I\'d love to be able to edit the squad formation or at least make em closer or further apart. Runs smoothly n looks great I wish I could zoom in a greater amount to enjoy it more. An the invisible enemy stages in the beginning are brutal without the cage shield n other abilities. It\'s been challenging, I like the world map and its random events.","Overall good game! Devs would you look into the pathfinding? Sometimes when I DoubleClick a spot one of my ops will get stuck somewhere... Also different environments in the woods when we have to engage and kill monsters... I don\'t like the auto-shooting... Maybe you guys could have an option to turn it on/off?? Game looks really good! No lag or crashes ... I have my game settings on high and it\'s doing amazingly! \ud83d\ude0a one more thing, could you add a normal mode? Only easy & hard available atm...","Games actually disappointing. I got interested in this game due to another game they produced, Space Marshals 2. That, absolutely love so let\'s see what else they got. The mix of old school 80s animation and computer graphics, does NOT work here. Plus random events via cards, it should simply happen and not be a card draw situation. A better way to have a functional tutorial and yet be a \\"make sense,\\" in game flow: have people in the team do backstory missions. You see their abilities.","Enjoying and engaging gameplay. You gear and deploy a 3 man squad (maybe more later in game?) The squad members gain random useful traits/mutations as they level up. Many of these are very cool to use. In a more expensive game I would ask for more classes and maybe branching weapon selections for the squad to add more strategy but as it is, its a great experience for the price. I also am a fan of using the cards to showcase most of the information as they do most of the time here.","I paid for it after the demo period thinking there would be more substance, but there isn\'t. I find that there are too few enemies and too few abilities to really change things. It has a gameplay loop similar to XCOM with combat being more fast-paced. Easy was a bit of a mindless slog. Turned it up to Hard (there is no Normal), and the randomized abilities cause a lot of early game forced losses as it becomes too easy to be overwhelmed and you don\'t have any abilities to do anything about it."],"appId":"com.pixelbite.xwt","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pixelbite.xwt&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.pixelbite.mutant":{"title":"Xenowerk","description":"Be the last hope against the mutant infestation.

It has micro-transactions (which I despise) but they were done correctly and not at all a nuisance. The gameplay loop is a solid, pick up and play for a few minutes one. The only reason I give it 4 stars is that all the levels are essentially visually the same. They\'re detailed and look good though, so it\'s only a minor complaint, frankly.","It\'s a great game, well it has potential to be great, 1. Missions need to be more hands, longer, and have better adjectives. 2. You should be able to buy (or earn) teammates to aid you. 3. It\'s currently boring how easy the enemies are to kill plus there\'s not many of them. 4. Just add some stuff like sas 3 did, well good luck with the game and keep at it.","Pretty awesome. A twin stick shooter with equipment upgrades. It works out of the box with my USB-C controller, and I couldn\'t be happier. It feels like a proper top-down action RPG, bit you can literally pick it up and clear a level with only five minutes to spare. Easy to pick up, have a minute of fun, and quit. Haven\'t even seen a single ad. This is not your usual Android store garbage.","The first time a free game wasn\'t shooting ads in my face every 10 seconds. Gameplay is reminiscent of Alien Swarm. It doesn\'t hold your hand, you might actually have to use your brain to pathfind through a level. The difficulty is fair, all around, looks like the kind of game that\'s worth someone\'s time. Makes me want to actually support the dev.","I enjoy this game. Graphics, game play, items/weapons leveling by experience gained from defeated aliens all well done. Only area I would immediately improve is what I can see while I\'m playing. For example, the camera is close down to the level, which I like especially the destructible environment and details like writing on walls, desks, etc. However, sometimes when moving backwards away from the enemies, shooting at them, they\'ll be off the screen, can\'t see what I\'m aiming at."],"appId":"com.pixelbite.mutant","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pixelbite.mutant&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.noxgames.hex.civ.strategy":{"title":"Hex Polis: Civ Outlanders 4x","description":"Hex Polis is stylizated turn-based strategy game.

Reminds me of the original Warcraft game style and energy.Great pace of play as well as a balance in upgrading. Please keep up the great work. Any chance of a one time remove all ads option?","I enjoy this game quite a lot, but I have a few critisisms. Unit previews don\'t show how far a unit can see. A unit with 2 sight nullifies the effects of watchtowers. A unit\'s standing animation usually slants to the side, making telling what tiles you can backstab from a bit awkward, if not worse because you can\'t take back movement options you select, meaning you can\'t try a side without commiting to it. Those are my gripes with the game.","Do not get this game. You play through levels so short there\'s barely any point to playing them. Its a naked money grabbing rip off of polytopia. The facing system really sucks, your guys spawn with their back facing the enemy so you get back stabbed straight up. So many things to pay for, its just awful. Don\'t waste your time.","This is a grueling obvious rip off of polytopia accept worse atlease it takes a few minutes to go through a round of polytopia in this I can barely get a few upgrades before my beginner unit bodies the enemy I think a larger scale map would be a huge improvement and tiles that slow but don\'t block units similar to what a game called unciv does"],"appId":"com.noxgames.hex.civ.strategy","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.noxgames.hex.civ.strategy&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.noxgames.mage.hero":{"title":"Mage Legends: Wizard Archer","description":"Roguelike super wizard RPG - Become magical archero and slay monsters in multiple dungeon battles.

There are ads for everything, and eventually the ads cause the app to close itself. Also, your pack prices are ridiculously high and they\'re not even good. No one will be paying $99.99, $199.99, or $399.99 to begin with, but you seriously think the reward of one item and handful of gems will entice anyone? Pure greed. Also, you have to grind so hard to get such little amounts of gold. I have so many scrolls I can\'t use to level my gear because of the tiny reward.","I can\'t wait for the city. I have to say this is a lackluster attempt in the shooter genre. It can\'t even get what it has copied, what every game in this genre slavishly copies, right. There is no progress counter so if you are taken out of the game you must start the chapter completely over. Some rooms repeat, some bosses repeat, even the hint of the day never changes reminding you to stop to shoot. I wanted to experience the unique city bent but I can no longer stand the game enough to do so.","04/30; fixed! 4/29: thank you! Updated 04/28 to say there\'s been 2 updates (at least) since my review and the Desert stage is still broken. Shielded enemies in level 46 don\'t register so you can\'t attack them and now they can\'t attack you, meaning you have to quit and waste what you earned. Fun, but stage 3, level 41-42 is bugged and you can\'t kill the enemies in it, stopping progress. Would like to give it a shot, but needs more equipment and the levels fixed","Better than Archero because equipment allows you to choose what abilities or skills you want to have. However, progress is painfully slow and equipment too hard to come by. The forge is pretty crappy. It only makes stuff I already have our don\'t need. Should be able to choose to try making a weapon or ring at the very least. Keep improving! Lots of promise.","I have been playing a lot of rogue-like shooting lately, and this game has more ad then the other simulator games like this one. I know you\'re trying to make money , but who wants to play a game that every powerups or free gears and have to wait 30 minutes to it. I know the simulator game doesn\'t add more ads then this game. Like the graphics,games play with different lvl powerups, and stage. I don\'t know the game save or if there is a way to save your game. Anyway that\'s my opinion when I play."],"appId":"com.noxgames.mage.hero","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.noxgames.mage.hero&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.gonzossm.sttt":{"title":"Su\u0440er Toss The Turtle","description":"BLAST.CO shop is back in business, and the competition has just risen to a whole new level!

Amazing visuals, easy goals to strive for, small micro transaction that you really don\'t need to help you progress in any way , no constant adds and if there is a add they reward you for watching with in-game currency to unlock more characters. It might be simple minded distance game but it\'s perfect and more mobile developers need to take notes","I love this! The upgraded weapon criteria. The animation redraws that feel just as charmingly nostalgic as the original. The only request I have is to add the option for the original song from the flash game to be an option to turn on. Like a Music Selection Button. The original song made me feel more like a space adventurer and I loved it. For old times sake, Gonzo. Please? Best wishes on every aspect of life, Kyra. (Agent K)","Very fun, has a huge number of creative unlockable characters besides the turtle, everything from a dolphin, a cat, a watermelon, and even a saiyan-like \\"fruitian\\". There are also good power-ups like the UI inspired super instinct. It has ads but they are built into the game in a way that doesn\'t ruin the experience.","You only watch the ads if you want to it\'s not forced. It only gets you skins for the character you play. This used to be an old flash game back in the day so it has nostalgia for me. Same thing and repetitive just make it a little further every time and get up grades not much skill needed but for a free game this has a lot going for it unlike others.","The game is addictive, the gore may not be for everyone but I think it\'s the best part! I keep shattering my highscores when I least expect it and thankfully it\'s not just another pay to win game, and once it starts to pick up you really make some cash and get the next best upgrade. A great way to pass the time, can\'t get the ad for 20 shells to work for some reason but I guess that\'s the best part, there\'s like no ads whatsoever!"],"appId":"com.gonzossm.sttt","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gonzossm.sttt&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.pixio.google.mtd":{"title":"Summoner\'s Greed: Idle TD Hero","description":"You, the greatest and most powerful summoner, broke into the King\u2019s castle and stole his priceless royal treasure!

But after seeing the funny meme-y ads, I gave this game a shot. So far, it\'s been really fun. Everything about this game just seems like smart mobile game design. Instead of playing ads after each wave or whatever, it gives you the choice to get rewards by watching ads. After losing a wave, you can either replay it or start over but you keep your summons\' levels and can relocate them. Kudos to the developer. I\'m impressed.","Pretty fun so far! Edit: with probably more than 20 hours into this game, I have nothing but good things to say. It\'s a fun \\"tower defense\\" game, with ample rewards through your progress. The game can get tough, but you\'re allowed to try again or back up some rounds. The ads are always optional, but do tend to be short and with a nice reward, so I rarely turn one down. 5 \u2b50 / 5 \u2b50 Great Game! Edit: I spent many hours on this game, and now I\'m back. I\'m hoping I\'ll get Monitor\'s rewards!","It\'s a fun game when you have the time to spare, I\'ve always loved tower defense\'s. The cute simple art style is great, in the future once I\'ve played more I hope to see creatures with just a (little) more design details but not a complaint. It\'s fun, thanks for making the ads for the game funny and honest, it did the trick. Lol","First of all, The ads for this game are adorable and finally broke me into downloading and playing it. So it\'s an adorable little tower defense that lets you build up over the course of several playthroughs of the waves. Lose on wave 10, start over and move your units that you summon around. Or you can try again with a buff and see if that\'s enough to push through. I\'m enjoying it :)","I decided to give this a try because the ads for it were pretty funny. All in all, it\'s a nice little tower defense game, but that\'s really about it. I think it would be better if wave progression continued even when you don\'t have the game open, and it notified you when you hit a wall, so to speak. Also, evolution items seem to be cash-only. Never a good idea. Maybe they\'re offered once you clear a certain number of waves, but that goes back to the game not progressing unless you have it open"],"appId":"com.pixio.google.mtd","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pixio.google.mtd&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.Wind.wings.Space.Shooter":{"title":"WindWings: Space Shooter","description":"\u25b6 FANTASY STORY\\n       The game is developed based on a fantasy story about a soldier who accidentally went through a time gap to the future.

A simple space shooter with easy controls and great colors and graphics. Pretty easy to upgrade because coins, rewards and such are in abundance. I love the slow down option because in games like this you just can\'t get outta the way sometimes. It\'s a game you\'ll wanna play all the way through barring any unknown surprise you gotta pay to win. But right now I like it. 5 stars.","Easy to pick up and put down. Paying the $20 for the premium version is well worth it. There are only one reason for not giving this game 5 stars, and that is the Fusion system. In the game, you get item upgrades for your ships, but it is controlled by a random generator, in addition to the ratios being poorly skewed. It makes going for (and therefore, investing in) fusing items relatively pointless. With the exception of that setup, this game is easily one of best time-killers I have played.","Excellent! Graphics are good, the game is fun. Gets tougher as you go, but not so quickly that I just get frustrated because it\'s \\"impossible\\" to win. I might have to restart several times, but not so often that I just quit playing. Actually, it\'s addictive once you start. The one negative is: programmers need to give SOME instruction on upgrading the ships, having multiple ships in play, the drones, and other equipment available for use. I\'ve had to trial and error figure out these things.","Recent update introduced incessant pop up ads that cannot be skipped. The dev response makes no sense. The use of a free game is a deal between the developer and the user. The user watches some ads in exchange for some value: either just the gameplay itself or an in-game item. If you change the amount of ads the user must watch to access the same value in the game, you changed the deal for the worse. I don\'t object to seeing ads. I object to being bombarded with them with no added value.","Best arcade space shooter. All the other\'s don\'t compare. Graphics are great. Game play is pretty fair it\'s good for beginners as well as experts. Multiple ways to upgrade the spaceships. They obviously took there time creating the game, instead of just throwing it together for some fast $$$. If you pay for the premium version you don\'t have to watch any ads. That might be the best part of the whole game.

Tower descriptions are often confusing (lightning tower \\"attaches bullets\\" to enemies?) or stupid (\\"slowly gun\\") or look like code. Things that you may like or dislike: hardest difficulty level is still easier than most game\'s normal mode, towers can be destroyed, and you can only put towers in predefined locations","Like it so far. Not the easiest but a good challenge. Have to figure some stuff out on your own because it doesn\'t really tell you much. Biggest complaint is that towers can be damaged/destroyed. You can\'t see all the field at once so you scroll down to place something, scroll back up and you\'ve lost a tower! It would be nice to put towers wherever you want instead of premarked locations also. Other than that, great graphics and fun to play.","Too much over there too graphics where you can\'t even tell what effect your choices are having. If you like being entertained not than engaged, you might like it more than I did. I like a clean game where I can calculate my choices and try out. The graphics in this game is pretty but make it chaotic and you can\'t really keep track of things.","Unfinished game. There are lots of things that simply not completed. 1. The Report Bug doesn\'t have a To email. 2. The menu red dots are inconstant. 3. There are Towers that don\'t have descriptions. Update: I would give it 0 starts. Starting at level 40, you have to complete ALL previous levels at ALL difficulties with PERFECT scores! Really?","How do these broken GD games get such high ratings? Don\'t trust anyone that has to cheat and pad their own ratings. This is so broken its nearly unplayable. By the 2nd level, much of the playing field is off the screen and you can\'t see the battle or place defense in all places. The screen won\'t move or adjust so you just see your defense firing into oblivion but don\'t fully see what\'s going on. It\'s clunky and not smooth mechanics. It\'s not terrible, but it\'s definitely nowhere near 4.9 stars."],"appId":"com.Gcenter.DefenselegendX.TowerDefense.TD","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Gcenter.DefenselegendX.TowerDefense.TD&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.alexanderwinn.landfall":{"title":"TerraGenesis: Landfall","description":"From the makers of TerraGenesis comes TERRAGENESIS: OPERATION LANDFALL - a city building simulator in which you can build, design, and manage your own city in space.

The highest research tiers are a bit too expensive (mid-tier ones are fine). The free placement is nice, but a quick rotation button could help. Could use separate counts for settlers and visitors. Finally, depleted outposts should be dismantled, so the map doesn\'t fill with so many gray markers. The game is still new as of writing, so I hope to see improvements made. Overall, though, good and recommended.","This is an excellent and entertaining take on the original game, featuring many realistic scenarios, costs, and graphics. It truly breaks through the normalcy of city-building games and colonization. They have done a great job balancing both wait times and monetization; ads are completely optional, and for that I sincerely thank the developers. Suggestion-wise, I would love to see higher graphics, and perhaps an option to hide the repair alerts for the sake of visuals. Thank you!","Great game so far! The Mechanics work great and it\'s fun to play. However the frequency of critical events is in my opinion too high. I\'m on the game for 5 minutes during which my batteries broke down, and engineer dies, disgruntled settlers steal a rover? Of all things, makes playing quite difficult, and seems. A little excessive. The zoom settings are sometimes hard to deal with. It would be nice if there was a slider option instead of 2 fixed zoom settings. Hope this helps. Keep it up!","Reduce stars 3 to 2... I\'m stuck! I\'ve finished the tutorial, have 80GP and now I\'m stuck because it is telling me to build a command center.. I already have one! I can\'t move past it. I\'ve tried to click the \\"Settings\\" wheel several times, but it\'s greyed out. All that needs to happen to for the \\"Settings\\" button to be enabled throughout the Tutorial. That way if someone wants to restart, they can.","This game is great, but it does have a few flaws that could be fixed. For example, the whole tutorial was pretty good but if you didn\'t finish it in one go, it would glitch. This would ultimately make it nigh impossible to complete said tutorial, and would require you too Uninstall to reinstall to fix this problem. After you do the tutorial, it is a great game.

I see what they were going for but at the end of the day it feels terrible to lose because of horrible luck. There is some strategy involved in the ability cards, but most of the time they\'re REQUIRED to win battles and not optional play styles. You could be totally min maxed with your cards and items and still get stomped by a tiny little slime because your luck is bad. Makes it hard to enjoy.","Found a bug. Repeated tree times. Went for a fourth and discovered there is a variable. I duplicated a card. Second use was free. Then after the round I got both of the cards back in my hand. It completely messed up the interface ui. After it happened the cards were stacking on top of each other in my hand. I got a few screen shots. I used all the cards in my hand and it reset the interface. So I did it again. After the second one I killed my self and went to scene 2-1 and did it again","This game has really good combat mechanics between the gauge and the way you can alter it. There are also insane combos and cards(power surge) that feel overpowered but make sense when you need to work for them. The only problem is that often times when you lose a few rounds then you rely on the deck and RNG seems to always favor the AI if I can\'t alter it.","I think the game is very fun and very well made. It\'s simplistic enough to understand quickly but complex enough for strategists. I\'ll admit, I get very frustrated sometimes because I never seem to make it past the second worlds. But that might just be me. It\'s a game that rewards you for learning the mechanics and upgrading. It\'s so satisfying to easily beat an enemy which used to be a problem. I feel like you rely more on confidence than upgrades.","Honestly one of the few phone apps that I feel ok with spending money on. It was like $5 to get all the \\"spirits\\" and you just get to keep them and use them over and over. It has replayability with the different classes and the continued dungeon mode, and each time you beat it something changes mechanically. Honestly one of the best games I have found in awhile.

Sometimes it requires patience, but that makes it easier to integrate into the rest of my life. I wish there was a single button (hit again to confirm) that would put it into pause mode and return to \\"desktop\\" without losing one\'s place in the game. In general, the battles are fun, and finding/achieving upgrades are satisfying, but sometimes frustrating. It has adequately filled the empty times in my life.","The gameplay mechanics are great. Combining tower types is a great ability that sets this game apart from other tower defense apps. I haven\'t felt any need to purchase anything so far in order to win, so that\'s a win. The downside is the grammar; sometimes the English translation is so bungled that you can\'t understand the directions. Doesn\'t make much of a difference on gameplay though, just makes the game feel cheaper.","As I fan of TD games I like this one but it has its issues. Great maps, worlds, towers, levels, heroes, and graphics. However it relies on ads waaaay too much and some levels/enemies are incredibly difficult to beat/kil and the heroes only gain experience if you beat the level (veeery slow progress at times.) Also there are too many options and spending money does not guarantee progress. The heroes to get are Satan, scorch blaze and Brion (I have not unlocked Waylin.) Don\'t get andor or cercle.","I want to see how much money and time the positive reviews spent on the game! One of the most egregious examples of forced pay to win I\'ve ever seen. On level 11 they have a map with an area your champion can\'t reach and there are not enough tower slots to stop the enemy mobs. The solution? Pay $0.99 to unlock a champion trapped in a cage up there. If that is not obvious enough, the cage bounces over and over during the match as you are losing, trying to get you to pay up before it\'s game over","Ok. People were complaining about unfair gameplay so I actually didn\'t spend a penny. (I usually get beginner packs and bonuses early since that\'s when they are most useful.) Yeah, it\'s tough but I went to 11 to see what the fuss was - yes you can cross the chasm with your hero. Just advance slowly. And you get the wolf free once you win that level. You don\'t need to buy it. Okay, so that\'s settled, I\'m buying stuff now. (Again, it\'s hard but not impossible.)"],"appId":"com.gcenter.kingofdefense.battle.frontier.td","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gcenter.kingofdefense.battle.frontier.td&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.Gcenter.KingofDefense2.epic.towerdefense":{"title":"King of Defense 2: Epic TD","description":"The sequel to King of Defense: Battle Frontier is King of Defense 2: Epic Tower Defense.

I think it has potential. First of all, lower the cost of, everything... Make it easier to obtain items, heroes, magic and so on. When you first start playing, you get a nice win streak going on then, you hit a brick wall. Unless you play already completed levels a hundred times over to rack up some crystals, gems, items and etc. Or, of course, you pay to play. Also, when I direct my hero to move, why does he run half way then go back?!","Pay-To-Win: Name of this game is simple. If you want to make it past the first few levels, open your wallet. It is a well put together game with great design and mechanic choices. It\'s too bad it is impossible to get past level 14 without buying your victory. This is a fun way to pass a few hours, but you will quickly delete it unless you\'re willing to buy your way past the very apparent pay-wall.","Starts out pretty fun but the difficulty scales up ridiculously quite quickly as a clear play to push players into microtransactions to progress without extensive grinding of earlier levels to eke out a tiny bit of progress after days or weeks of playing the same missions repeatedly and constantly bombarding you with pop-ups for \\"deals\\" on premium currency, heroes, pets and so on. A good example is that you \\"unlock\\" pirate hero but it really just unlocks the ability to buy him. Trash.","The game is great, I enjoy it, and the ads are not invasive, but there is a very annoying bug... In the tournament supposed to be 100 levels. I got to 25 and the game just stops. If I get out of the mode, then I lose the progress. It is very annoying as I spent a lot of time on it. Also, it is not clear where and how to contact support if there is any.","Good but too many adds. Even the tutorial forces you to view pay only upgrades. There are adds and pay options everywhere on the screen. Clean it up and stop forcing the pay to play might be better than the first game."],"appId":"com.Gcenter.KingofDefense2.epic.towerdefense","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Gcenter.KingofDefense2.epic.towerdefense&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.hyperdotstudios.mythiclegends":{"title":"Mythic Legends","description":"Build an army of Champions and Legends, plan your strategy and watch them fight it out in the arena in this epic auto chess inspired strategy RPG.\\n\\nGo to battle in the arena\\nSelect the right combo of Champions from your deck, place them in the arena and watch them clash with your opponent\'s army.

This is more of plee to the devs than a review, but my biggest gripe is after winning a few tournaments in a row you get put in one where everyone is a higher level then you and you get steamrolled without any chance of actually winning. Makes me feel like I have to waste time throwing battles to get back to where I ought to be at.","I really want to enjoy this game, it\'s very smooth and looks nice... But after I spent a few hours and almost all of my red gems trying to unlock there 4th hero, I just can\'t do it. If it\'s RNG to draw the cards, then it needs improvement. If you can\'t actually unlock willow through the battles, then that needs to be explained somewhere. All of the others so far were unlockable that way.","This game is very entertaining and very easy to get into. It\'s a easy to play hard to master type of auto battle game but its simple in its approach which is great for new players. It\'s character diversity, body diversity it really has it all besides the music and sound effects could do a little better. But the main reason for the low review is the Massive pay to win here. You will get destroyed by any wallet warrior its really a shame because this game is great.","Initially the game seems to be pretty good. I enjoy TDs & this one is a new spin for me. However, I was having issues with my phone & had to uninstall & reinstall some apps, this being one...I can\'t back out of the tutorial to even find out if I lost all my progress or not (nor adjust volume in game settings), I\'m hoping it backed up...but it seems that I\'ll have to complete the tutorial again \ud83d\ude12 before I\'ll know if I\'m given an option load previous data. Really needs skip tutorial option.","5* -> 2* Originally this game was awesome. But I had to lower my rating for 1 major game breaking reason. During the matches the pairing isn\'t a queue or round robin. It\'s fully random. I\'ve had games where every other fight I went back to the same person. Sometimes someone just has a way higher rating and will beat you, but if you played everyone else you could still get 2nd. But instead you could end up playing that person 3 times and never play every other player resulting in a loss."],"appId":"com.hyperdotstudios.mythiclegends","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hyperdotstudios.mythiclegends&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.lemonjamstudio.infiniteknights":{"title":"Infinite Knights - Idle RPG","description":"The good King had died, and no one could decide.\\nWho was rightful heir to the Throne.\\nIt seemed that the land would be torn by devils,\\nOr saved by a miracle alone \u2014\\nAnd that miracle appeared in the countryside of the the kingdom:\\nThe Sword in the Stone.\\nThe one who pull the sword, will become the king and lead the knights to defeat devils.\\n\\nAre you the one, who can pull up the sword?\\n\\n\u25a0 Addictive Turn-based RPG \\nGet to Floor 2000 and defeat the Devil King\\n\\n\u25a0 Automatically Offline Income! \\nYou can upgrade the village, get incomes while you are offline.\\n\\n\u25a0 Infinite Heroes\\nAll heroes are randomly generated.

Concepts can be fun but daily rewards are just options to watch more ads. Almost every action brings new adds. Sometimes it displays the button as an ad other times it says claim but is an ad. There is no option to go completely ad free. Just every time you purchase gems you get a few ad free tokens, this is also on top of a monthly subscription that doesn\'t prevent ads. Based on the first 20 minutes of gameplay i had 10 adds, so I\'d say there is an average of 20 per day.","Its a fun game for the most part, alot of ads if you want to do stuff, but hey they have to make money too....only issue is that i think its a dead game, no discord, and no directions on what things do... .like the alter of new heros, has quest to unlock new heros, but after you complete the quest it lets you \\"level up the class\\" but as far as i can tell it does nothing","Great, simple fun, combining standard turn based rpg and idle gaming. Only drawback is you can\'t manage their equipment, there\'s auto-equip, then that\'s it, what they grab is what they have, seemingly forever. Making it virtually impossible to keep the same characters competitive over time as their equipment will simply get outdated and you can\'t upgrade it. Just to make it worse, the auto equip will make some wonky choices.","Love the gameplay. Easy to pickup and learn how combat works. The characters look great and I love how they have different appearances. It might just be a issue with my game, but any time I attempt to load a ad, the game freezes then crashes. The sound is missing from gameplay as well. Overall, a great game but a issue lowers my rating.","So it\'s a good game, but there are some glaring errors: 1) Please change the \\"can\'t fetch ads\\" pop-up! If I\'m connected to the internet and YOU can\'t fetch ads, that\'s your problem not mine so don\'t ask for payment because you failed. 2) Increasing the star-level of items you make should always be done with gold (maybe with a video option if you can\'t afford the gold)! Watching an ad should be a choice, not mandatory. This is compounded by error 1 too!"],"appId":"com.lemonjamstudio.infiniteknights","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lemonjamstudio.infiniteknights&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.yodo1.rodeo.safari":{"title":"Rodeo Stampede: Sky Zoo Safari","description":"Saddle up and get ready to wrassle with the stampede-iest critters this side of the Savannah.

I don\'t think you should have to put your device into airplane mode just to avoid the amount of ads that get dumped on you. It\'s VERY annoying. After just about every time you die there\'s an ad waiting for you. While I realize ads mean money and as a company money needs to be made, there are ads to double coins, revive, etc. Those are fine. You can purchase something from the shop to get rid of them, but I don\'t have money to drop","When i first installed this game it was super fun. All you have to do to get rid of the ads is turn of your wifi and mobile data but when my zoo started to get bigger and bigger it now has so many bugs to the point where I don\'t enjoy the game anymore. Every time I try to play the Jurassic park it always stays on the loading screen and i always have to restart it. I think if yodo1 would fix these bugs I would and everyone else would enjoy this game much more but that is why I give this 2 stars.","Game is fun most of the time but it\'s overrun with ads, after almost every loading screen there\'s an ad, if you ever play this game I recommend putting it in airplane mode to get rid of the ads. (Note for response: I understand that revenue is needed from ads but it shouldn\'t get to the point where it ruins the experience, I now fear messing up a run because that means I\'ve got to watch an ad afterwards, but I want to make it clear this is a good game)","I have contacted support for multiple big issues. It\'s been days without reply. Playing in the space zoo, once I finish the last of the 3 missions and the run is over,there is no \'done\' button just a blank screen and I have to exit and open the game again, completely losing the ability to upgrade any space zoo enclosure. So the game just acts like the missions never happened and I get 3 new missions but no enclosure upgrade. The game has gotten buggy and makes it hard to binge play like before.","I love this game I really do. I\'ve been pkaying it for a few years now, but it\'s gotten a bit buggier. Of course thats expected with the zoos getting larger, but my biggest problem right now is the ads. To retry you need to watch an ad, but you are unable to close the ad after its finished. So you restart the game, and have to rewatch the ad to play once again. Please fix this! I love the new ocean map but it sucks that I can barely play it."],"appId":"com.yodo1.rodeo.safari","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.yodo1.rodeo.safari&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.sparklingsociety.cityisland5":{"title":"City Island 5 - Building Sim","description":"Build a city, your city\\n\u201cCity Island 5 - Tycoon Building Simulation Offline\u201d, a new city builder game from Sparkling Society, will make you the mayor of small town starting on just one island.

The constant, incessant ads that randomly pop up, that are required for getting any rewards has almost made this game unplayable. The events are now just repetitive and trite. I don\'t see myself playing this game much longer. Enjoyable game to pass the time if you like these kind of sims. A little too easy to click the wrong button and spend coins or keys you\'re trying to save up, but otherwise no major issues.","Follow up from April. Date 8/23/22, Still crashing at random. Just did the update an was hoping it would help. It didn\'t which is disappointing. Still don\'t have the rare decorations. I do like the Catch the crook.. please help! 4/27/22. The game has crashed 6 times in the last 13 minutes. I keep writing reviews & writing to the developers but it is being deleted or removed. This is irritating !! An way too many pop up ads even for a \\"free\\" game. Especially one that you make purchases in","It\'s a really fun game but realistically it takes too long to get to certain levels. For example with the snow level it asked for Community buildings I\'m in level 16 but I have to wait to get to level 34 to get Community Builders realistically that\'s too long and I don\'t know if I\'ll be interested in keep doing it by then. It\'s too hard to earn the dollar gold coins and requires too many coins to achieve things.","Good features and and not so good. It is tough to make a game with the right reward to longevity ratio. This game makes a decent attempt. \ud83e\udd14 The Good -Nice graphics\ud83d\ude01 -Nice concept of multiple islands with different characteristics.\ud83d\ude42 The Bad -No help file (that I could find) to describe the meaning of things. \ud83e\udd14 -Does not automatically collect profits. Forces you to constantly touch screen, for me very annoying. \ud83e\udd28 -Cars driving around forces you to constantly tap screen. Again annoying. \ud83d\ude12","Been enjoying the game for about 3 hours over a day /half making steady progress. One might initially think it\'s a money grab but with a little patience and quest completion there\'s plenty of cash to be made for further advancement. I really appreciate the amount of buildings that can construct and/or upgrade simultaneously. I will have to research what a couple of the road options are for but for now I Think I found a game I\'ll put some spare time in to."],"appId":"com.sparklingsociety.cityisland5","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sparklingsociety.cityisland5&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.dvdfu.chicken2":{"title":"Chiki\'s Chase","description":"Chiki\'s Chase is a high-speed, tricky action platformer.

It\'s cute, pretty, fun, challenging but not too frustrating, and there are no ads! I recommend you buy the full game to support the dev if you can though. The pixel graphics are crisp and colorful, and the sounds and haptics really add to the feel of the game. I like how the shopkeeper dialogue changes with the context. I do wish getting hurt didn\'t make you lose all your stars, and there was an option to flip jumping and attacking.","I love the game, it\'s art and everything about it. It is amazing, I at first thought it would be like most over runner games but I was pleasantly surprised that there were no ads. At all, just a something telling you to buy the ability to collect gems at the end of run, as well as no other in app purchases. Just a single easy one time payment that you don\'t even need to purchase for the full game.","Outstanding side-scrolling game that harkens back to original Mario games. (There is even an element of super mario RPG here.) Gameplay is simple and fun with room for upgrades and ever-changing levels. I wish there was a better \\"checkpoint\\" system as starting all over at the beginning can get mundane. Well done for this programmer\'s first game! I bought the full version as it is worth it.","I would like to preface this by saying I am not one who is easily pleased. But I must say, this game is INCREDIBLE. The soundtrack, the concept, everything. This is one of few games that can always be enjoyed in its original format. There\'s so much to love about Chiki - the character balancing, the simple yet high-ceiling movement capabilites, the sheer number of upgrade combos/strats possible... I could go on and on. And it\'s not super time demanding! Instant classic, 100% worth the download \ud83d\udc4f","I absolutely adore this game. I love all of the small details, this truly is one of the best mobile games I have downloaded in a long time! A few of my favorite things: - EVERYTHING HAS A SOUND!!! You can tell what\'s coming just by the sound it makes! - I LOVE how the lasers add a bass track to the background music! A few suggestions: - It would be really cool if different objects also added tracks, like the lasers. - More statements from the store clerks, maybe? A bit more variety."],"appId":"com.dvdfu.chicken2","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dvdfu.chicken2&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.fluffyfairygames.idleminertycoon":{"title":"Idle Miner Tycoon: Gold & Cash","description":"Are you a true gold miner?

Write us an email: community@idleminertycoon.com","comments":["Unlike a lot of mobile games I\'ve been playing, this game is both not unfinished and there are no forced ads. You\'re going to watch them though to make any progress whatsoever because you\'re darn sure the prices they charge for their silly little digital items, which let me remind you are not real, is absurd. Could easily spend hundreds of USD and have little to show for it. Also $15 USD ad remover. The option to spend money litters the screen at all times. Wallets beware.","The game is great, and I only have one problem so far... the ads! I know, I know, people say that about so many games & the developers need their money, but I have to put my phone on airplane mode to play. Often times the ads are optional, but you also get random ads. I don\'t like to spend my money on games, so I\'m not going to get the \\"no ads\\" pass thing, so it\'s kind of is my fault that there are ads, but it just ruins the experience when I get a random ad.","I got this game to get diamonds on My Dear Cat thinking I would completely hate it, planning to delete after I get my reward, but I actually enjoyed it. It\'s only 4/5 stars because of the ads. Thats about my only complaint, but y\'all do need to fix that for sure. It would be a much better game. Also the prices for no ads, that isn\'t as much as an issue though as the amount of ads.","It\'s a really fun game and I love the mining and different mines and explorations it is a really nice touch that there are different ones. There are really great offers in the games and the game treats you well! The only tiny problem I have is that it sometimes stops but that\'s just because everything is running at the same time. I really do enjoy this game! :)","I\'ve only played the game about 30 minutes total (in my spare time) in 2 days. The more tunnels you have, the more money you make in the game. I haven\'t tried cashing out yet because I doubt I have enough points for anything. The game keeps you fairly active with the boosters for the tunnels which makes time fly. I enjoy it, just give it a try!"],"appId":"com.fluffyfairygames.idleminertycoon","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fluffyfairygames.idleminertycoon&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.prineside.tdi2":{"title":"Infinitode 2 - Infinite Tower Defense","description":"Every game in this Tower Defense strategy game (TD) is endless - stand against infinite number of enemy waves for as long as you can!\\n\\nComplete the story line for great rewards.\\n\\n- Simplistic, well optimized, tiny in size but overfilled with features: 14 different types of towers, 11 types of enemies, bosses, miners, teleports, barriers, modifiers, resources...\\n- Over 40 different levels with leader boards and plenty of quests - no endless grind!\\n- Towers gain experience, abilities, different aiming strategies and can be heavily upgraded\\n- Miners can be used to dig out Resources for new global upgrades\\n- Map editor can be used to build any map with resources won for each game.\\n- Music tracks are stored in maps and played with synthesizer!

I think that the interesting mechanics of bosses and the balanced enemies really makes you use your brain more, instead of mindlessly placing one tower. Plus, i just think that ADVINAS and the story line is just great. i cant wait to see what the future has to offer for this game.","Played this on steam, and loaded my data onto my phone to keep playing. Very fun game! Completely free, at least so far. You can spend money, but it\'s not really required in any way, it\'s more just there so you can support the devs if you choose to. Lots of maps, lots of towers, lots of enemies, really its a bang up job all around! Highly recommended!","Surprisingly deep for just a tower defense game. Having to spend the same single run currency on resource gathering as well as towers to progress makes you think a little more and have to prioritize one over the other. That, along with the insane size of the skill tree leaves a lot to do in the game. Be warned that the game is heavily ad driven when it comes to getting bonuses and such","Very fun tower defense game, with more technical appeal and strategy than superficial graphics-focused games of its genre. If you prefer depth over showy effects, you will love this game. Also, the ads are only for receiving free rewards (which are quite decent), not random popups or requirements to progress from one screen to the next! The developers actually want their players to enjoy the game, not mindlessly click through ads!","Just started playing this afternoon. I\'m hooked, there is so much content to work towards it blows my mind, this would sell great if it had a price tag. The start was a little overwhelming but it\'s a lot easier to figure out the menus and such after the tutorial. Very well designed tower defense game! Looking forward to more content from this development team!!

","comments":["Originally thought this to be a clickbait game but the gameplay is exactly as advertised. It\'s a good way to pass the time and definitely can be addicting. It would be cool if there was an option to make it more challenging. I paid for the ad free version years ago and the app remembered it when I re-downloaded it now. It can be played offline but to really get some of the cool stuff, you\'ll have to watch ads. Overall I\'d say 4.5\u2b50\ufe0f","LOVE the game. I would have rated 5 stars, however, I am on Level 1,572 and the levels are so repetivitive. Also, what is killing me is that I have been on the same level for 3 weeks now because the game keeps crashing. I love the game, and don\'t even mind the ads, so I have been patiently waiting for this issue to be resolved, but I\'m about to just delete it. I used to play off and on every day. Now I may TRY to play once every few days but still crashes4 seconds in... PLEASE fix this.","Overall a good game. It can get a little bit of challenging with some of the later levels. It does contain ads about every other two runs. Sometimes free stuff would come but it would be in and cost of an ad. There was a moment where I said no thanks to watching an ad, but it still played an ad. I am not much of an ad person. But overall, a fun game to get into.","Cool concept and fun to play for the first 30 minutes or so. Annoying to have to wait to get the gun shop and find nothing of use over and over again. I stuck it out and finally bought the $10,000 machine gun only to find that the $1,000 one that I bought near the beginning was way better. Very repetitive with no payoff after about the first 25 levels. It\'s literally the same thing over and over with new outfits. The guns don\'t get any better and every level is super easy.","Enjoyed the first thirty or so levels. Seemed like a decent idea, short obstacles with bullet time. Paid the $2.99 to remove ads because of how many ads there were and I had been enjoying the game. After about an hour I noticed most of the levels were recycled. The difficulty does not go up and there are maybe 40 different layouts of levels. Lack of variety make this game boring. $2.99 isnt bad for like an hour of entertainment. But thats all this game is worth.

It\'s simple to learn, but compelling. Great, art. And for awhile, it actually was fun. But... The ad model is awful. An 30 second ad every time you die if you want to continue your progress. But the game play is what really cuts it for me. Game physics change randomly so what worked before might not work the next time. Lighting changes to where you can\'t see your player. Quests that depend on unreachable goals. Ruins the game","O: There is a loud, obnoxious ad after nearly each round. Also, opting to watch an ad to revive Alto will close the game, causing it to restart the round instead of picking up where he landed. It is very irritating. I downloaded the app yesterday. I have only played a couple times, and it seems like fun. The effects of the ads are annoying, though. UD: Paid to remove ads. Now it glitches, moving the character in a way that causes crashes. Glitches also shake the scene causing round loss.","Sort of fun, controls are simple, and not much explanation is given. Would be a soft 5 stars BUT when I choose not to watch a 30-second unskipable ad to revive, I\'m still hit with watching a 30-second unskipable ad just to start over. Not a huge issue except I keep getting long flat sections (can\'t do tricks) followed by chasms that require a lot of speed to cross (you see why the ad issue is frustrating now, right?). Uninstalling, may try again in a year.","It\'s a very relaxing game, just as the last one was. The soundtrack is very immersive if you put in earbuds, like the sound of sledding on the sand and the grinding on the vines and the music is wonderful and pleasant even after an hours worth of play, the storm and waterfalls are just amazing. And not to mention the detailed landscapes\u2764\ufe0f The only slight problem is that it\'s more sensitive than the last game and the ads are a bit more frequent.","It\'s fun and zen and easy to lose hours to. The problem for me is the ads. The game\'s main draw is a sort of zen flow state, and these ads blasting in your ear completely take you out of it. Also, when you die, it\'ll offer you an ad to revive. If you turn down the ad, sometimes it\'ll play anyway and give you nothing. I don\'t know what the alternative is, since all things must be monetized, but it\'s yet another case where capitalism has robbed a game of the thing that makes it compelling."],"appId":"com.noodlecake.altosodyssey","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.noodlecake.altosodyssey&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.hyperbeard.odyssey":{"title":"Tsuki\'s Odyssey","description":"Tsuki\u2019s Odyssey is a passive adventure game that immerses you into the world of Tsuki and the oddball characters of Mushroom Village.\\n\\nDecorate your home, make friends, catch all kinds of fish and so much more!\\n\\nIt is important to note that Tsuki is not your pet, but a free spirit who will move and interact with the world as they please.

I love this game because you don\'t have to P2P anything if you don\'t want to. If you want to buy more items to decorate your treehouse, you can just fish and sell your catches to get carrots. I do wish there was an unlockable feature to expand the treehousewhen you reach milestone levels. It would be great to have more space to put all the furniture in.","Great concept, wonderful characters and personalities, beautiful music, the pieces of furniture and items and everything are all adorable! Each day I couldn\'t wait to talk to everyone and see what they will tell me next, every few hours I check in to what new items could be available in the shops, each fishing spot has their own unique fishes! There are a few very noticeable bugs and unsure as to where exactly to report them, such as dialogues, the entire lighthouse being NOT at the back, etc.","Cute and relaxing! It is pretty slow, especially once you get to level six, but the best part is, there are no ads unless you choose to watch them! The weekly comic on the town hall message board is probably the best part of the game! The only thing that is frustrating is that I have been stuck for SEVERAL WEEKS because the only achievements I haven\'t got are the fishing ones, but the big fishing pole I need to buy to achieve this isn\'t popping up in the store... Losing interest.","I played the original Tsuki game and loved it. This is enough of a departure to be new but there are cumbersome aspects. Having to go to the map every time you want to visit a different area is time consuming vs the OG game. At least a quick option between house and carrot garden would make decorating between the two much easier. I also have no idea how to progress. That\'s nice to an extent, but I\'m not sure if I\'m supposed to be doing specific things or not. The music is lovely, tho, as always.","Great game!I love the fact that the option of watching an ad gives you 250 carrots (the in-game currency) and I also love the fact that you can design your house however you want it to and make lots of friends. I also like the pictures. Those are really cute! I never played the 1st,but the 2nd is Great! One thing you could add though, is maybe skills, like charisma or fishing!

Happy crushing!","comments":["This is THE Castles Crusher game from my childhood ! So simple yet challenging. The ads system seem broken, didn\'t have ads for most of the first game , but after that every few mission I would have a 15-30 sec were my screen was just freeze, as if the game was thinking it was showing me a ads(To be clear I didn\'t see any ads , just the screen freeze )","A solid repacking of the original trilogy with bonuses, but horrendously optimized; perhaps some memory leak. All games in the collection can occasionally have enormous, unplayable bursts of lag that persist until a restart. Pair this with occasional moments in the last game where fireballs and debris will just abruptly disappear during the action, and it\'s clear this needs more time in the oven; but the games are technically free elsewhere, so you\'re just paying for mobile accessibility.","I was excited when i found this. I shouldn\'t have been.. The ads appear after 20 levels, but then it\'s an ad after every - single - level. And don\'t think you\'ll get away by turning off your connection or blocking the apps internet access. The game still fades down for a good 10+ seconds while it desperately tries to load an ad for you, and you can\'t click anything during this time. The poor performance is another thing, once I got to the \\"second\\" game it was pretty much unplayable even on low.","Only played the original 2 so far and they\'re as good as they ever were. Great to have them available to play! But they are in desperate need of optimisation for mobile, I\'m getting constant frame drops and game speed ups/slow downs which make it particularly annoying to play at times. A UI pass and wide-screen update would be great too. As mentioned, the games are still great, they just need bringing up to modern standards.","As of right now (day 1 release day that is) the game performance especially the first two games is very poor, please improve performance. Aspect ratio is also very problematic, seems like it\'s only 4:3 while it should cover my entire screen(and during gameplay too) UI is okay, but not as easy to use as the android port of crush the castle Please fix these issues and it can easily go we over my initial 3 star rating"],"appId":"com.armorgames.ctclegacy","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.armorgames.ctclegacy&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.playsidestudios.idlearea51":{"title":"Idle Area 51","description":"The aliens have CRASH landed!!\\nSalvage as much alien tech as possible from the downed UFO and take it to your super secret desert facility for research in Idle Area 51.\\n\\nStart small and build your operation from scratch.

","comments":["Awesome little time burner. Issues at the last level with numeric values rolling over to near zero, you can\'t get enough money to finish the game. I recommend you get the add free option, it makes game play much easier and faster. Be careful with the reset player data, you lose any rubies over a certain amount. I\'m on my 4th reset and will continue to play. I wish they would add more levels after the air force base. Please add more alien antics!!","Progress in this game is BRUTALLY slow. Like.. Unbearable, unattainable, unrelenting, unpleasantly slow. For an \\"idle\\" game, you are required to return every 2 hours.. TWO HOURS. That is not an idle game. That\'s a money grabber. Everything is ad based. Upgrades are extremely expensive but you get almost nothing from your 2hr gains. Just is not worth it.","For starters, the creator of this game just wants money. Progressing slowly but fast enough to get to the next stage requires watching a high number of ads. The set amount of everything is too high, and because of this, it takes forever to get anywhere. Second, I\'m not buying a PS5 game, $100+ for a minimum amount of resources, it\'s insane. I\'m not here to pay your rent, so change some things up because this is just ridiculous. Third, you can\'t save your data, I wonder what that\'s about.","I really like this game but there are so many bugs out makes it hard to enjoy. My examples are that I like quiet games. In almost every game I play I have muted but after each ad it let\'s some sound slip through. I have to go into settings and turn on and off the sound again. Other than that I don\'t like how I get a notification I can\'t fix. Like the clipboard in the corner, is always on even when I don\'t have any missions completed. It\'s like that for most things and I find it annoying.","It is a cute game. A standard idle game and interesting. There is a bug where the 2x button is underneath the upgrade lab button and is not disabled when the lab pop up is visible. So when I am trying to upgrade the lab I repeatedly get a pop-up asking if I want to watch a video to double profit.

You begin with relating the basic shape, size, and gill/other information and the app narrows down your search. Tap on the basket at the bottom, and it gives additional options for narrowing your search (stem and cap characteristics, etc.)","Incredibly versatile and useful. They absolutely need to expand their catalogue, though. Minor note, I can\'t click the URL link on some descriptions because they are at the bottom of the info cards, which overlap the navigation buttons on my phone. Maybe add a small dead zone banner as a footer to compensate for this in some phones.","I don\'t like the design overall. The art is beautiful but the app cover has a large key covering the art and it just looks terrible. It also only gives the scientific names of the mushrooms when your scrolling, which could be confusing for beginners in mushrooms. If you\'re looking for a good mushroom app i would recommend shroomify, it\'s easier to navigate.","Amazing app! I love the fact that you can look at recipes and that there is a Journal. The purchased aren\'t required, but I bought them anyways to support the developers. Yes, the predictions can be wrong at times, but it does give you a warning to not 100% trust their predictions. The only complaint I have is that there could be more mushroom species, but it\'s fine. Also, you can download one of the features without paying and it still works, you might want to fix this.","i wish the recognition wasn\'t so hard to snag the photo and also would like to be able to mark on map where i found the species and able to see others picks. now i know nobody gives their picking spot, but that option for those who dont mind, would be nice. plus are all north American species in this app? thank you for making something that ensures that I know what I\'ve got, beyond a reasonable doubt."],"appId":"bazinac.aplikacenahouby","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bazinac.aplikacenahouby&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.erow.stickmanheroes":{"title":"One Gun: Stickman","description":"This game is the greatest RPG action game, is combination of fighting games and shooting games.

However it literally takes too long move in to the higher levels. You have to watch videos to get big amounts of coins and even then you beat like 1 or 2 levels before having to watch another like 10 videos just to maybe get to the next level. This game relies on watching ads to level up because without them it would take forever to get the amount of coin needed","I really like this game, but I remember a time when it was harder to get items, when there were no ads to watch to get coins, I just came back to this game and I\'m sad to see it become so easy. If I would recommend something, I would recommend to make it harder to get coins and rare items, maybe set a limit on the amount of ads someone can watch to get money, also add more weapons that cause knockback, it\'s super fun to win by never getting touched, I only think one weapon causes knockback.","I think its a gery good way to pass time and play for fun. I find it super fun because of all the different ways to upgrade like equipment and skills. One thing i find annoying is that super gun pop up. It looks like a bow. Its not the constant pop up that is annoying its that the pop up stops the music and interrupts my groove. If you could make it not interrupt my groove I would be appreciative. Thx great game.","Could be a fun game.. If it wasn\'t riddled with ads. Got to the minigun, only for it to just.. stop firing every few seconds. Im holding the attack button, nothing happens. Game now crashes VERY frequently, the menus are confusing as hell for new players, and the difficulty is so weirdly scaled with no hints as how to unlock certain abilities.","Would be five stars but after buying the 10 elite chests with the minigun at level 50 my game crashed(for the first time yet) and I lost all the items. There doesn\'t seem to be a restore purchases option either. Also, the \\"no ads\\" purchase with different characters doesn\'t cancel the rewards ads which is extremely frustrating considering how many it takes to unlock chests. The small boxes should be at most one ad to unlock. It makes the game nearly impossible to progress in"],"appId":"com.erow.stickmanheroes","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.erow.stickmanheroes&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.ketchapp.rider":{"title":"Rider","description":"Get ready for some flippin\' action!\\n\\n\\n\\nPerform insane stunts while you cruise through the never-ending world of Rider!

I really enjoy it. Good selection of bikes and a good thing to play when you have nothing to do. However, the random bike feature is not good at all, due to the fact that it chooses like 5 bikes and doesn\'t actually cycle through your entire garage. There are a few bugs as well and some obstacles that aren\'t possible, but still a fun game. Edit: I decided to add the fact that sometimes it flips you for no reason, and that can be frustrating. Also the music can be a bit repatative.","It was fun until it started flipping with my interaction. The game decides to flip on it\'s own, a lot of the platforms are set just far enough off that it will bounce you off course. I understand that it may need to limit your speed but just intentionally ruin the game? Why? \\"You\'ll get more cars cause they effect your game.\\" Which is true. The vehicle you drive can heavily affect your game.","I thought it was an amazing flawless game at first but I keep bouncing off of things that shouldn\'t be bounced on or going to fast and not being able to control the car while crashing into the next obstacle, and somthing when i use an ad it sends me back to the home screen? I know how hard it was to create this game but mabye there should be some sort of brake thing? Sometimes you shouldnt fix whats not broken and its a really good game other then the very small glitches!","Really fun, but sometimes I\'ll watch an ad to get revived and be sent back to the title screen anyway, or spawned off a cliff and die immediately. The game is far too inconsistent and glitchy to be considered great, physics don\'t work consistently and the random nature of the obstacles means sometimes you\'ll be going too fast to survive the next one, or too slow to make a jump, but you won\'t know until it\'s too late. Good way to kill time unless you have rage issues like I do.","I found it quite intertaining, there isn\'t to many adds either. The game has simple controls that are easy to learn aswell. I wish the transition from easy to hard was a little better though. There is a few glitches, like I can be on the ground and be holding down the button to move forward but randomly flip and die. Sometimes it\'s laggy near the start if not great internet. Over all, I suggest you play the game when your waiting or have a short amount of free time before your busy again."],"appId":"com.ketchapp.rider","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ketchapp.rider&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.maddog.shaqfu":{"title":"ShaqFu: A Legend Reborn","description":"The world lies on the brink of disaster.

Have played similar platform games before and had no issues with its controls, but can\'t say the same for ShaqFu\'s.","Why only four star despite having a blast with this games and perhaps one of the best games I\'ve come across so far, you have to purchase /spend money to progress in the game, to me games should be free, really disappointed that you need to spend money to play the next stage, please make it free, plisss plisss, make it free and this game has the potential to become one of the best game in the platform, and making it free will certainly help in attracting more gamers","The story crashes, black screen takes forever to load, the only thing free-to-play is chapter 1, and the analog stick sometimes gets stuck to where I can\'t move. Fun to play but too many deficiencies or errors to make the game enjoyable. Make all the chapters free then I will re download this game."],"appId":"com.maddog.shaqfu","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.maddog.shaqfu&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.spcomes.zombiehive":{"title":"Zombie Hive","description":"Destroy the zombies and rescue the survivors at the underground secret weapons laboratory infected with the virus.

The ads don\'t bother me, but there\'s not a lot to do besides wait then scroll up and down your floors and click on the doors/super zombies. Currency takes a while to accumulate and it does not gather offline, so really the experience of this game is leaving your phone running it and doing something else.","This game is not bad. But do the ads roll in. It is set up to make you want to watch ads for premium currency (only way to upgrade your bonuses). Then you get an ad almost everytime you open a chest, fight a zombie boss on a floor, or open a door to rescue someone. I would have stayed if it wasnt for the ads constantly popping up every time I played the game","It isnt worth it friends. There is no \\"no ad\\" package so even when you put money into it you still get ads. The game is super slow with very little replayability. It has no normal incremental growth. Instead it is very much a \\"pay to play\\" and \\"pay to advance\\". Sure you could go at it free but you\'ll be stuck there for weeks with little to no advancement.","This is a good game for when I\'m taking a breather from life. The one thing that bugs me is the ads, there\'s an ad after every 3 zombies, there\'s an ad when changing menus, there\'s even the occasional idle ad when I\'m not even doing anything. In short when I\'m playing seriously, I shouldn\'t have to see 7 ads in the span of a single minute","Fun and easy overall, but the jump of in game currency for upgrades is pretty high. You go from paying 100 coins to 100,000.and getting that doesn\'t come easy. But, an easy to get into game with pretty good potential. I\'d like to see more characters or specialists and maybe be able to place them on certain levels, and an easier way to grind in game currency or a more steady increase in price."],"appId":"com.spcomes.zombiehive","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.spcomes.zombiehive&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.foursakenmedia.blockfortressempires":{"title":"Block Fortress: Empires","description":"Welcome to the Blockverse - a mysterious and dangerous universe made out of cubes.

However, there are a few things that I think could be fixed. For example, in my opinion, this game is only playable if you turn the look sensitivity and attack look sensitivity all the way down, and play in first person. Most of the guns are extremely difficult to aim if not played with these specifications, which could possibly be fixed by making the crosshair bigger. Other than that, it is a mostly perfect game.","I would give more stars is i knew how exactly to change my defense station from the default. I spent a lot of time on the second defense systems and want to change over to that one instead of default. But i can\'t seem to figure it out as there is no options to do so from what i have seen so far. Could i het some assistance in this? The game is awesome so far besides this seemingly annoying glitch.","It is quite an interesting game, and although the melt guns are rather overpowered, this game is pretty good! I think previously my suggestion was a bit nonsensical, but I just recently cooked up an idea that would help most of the playerbase. If instead of just getting what you get with an upgrade, you can choose what and how much you to upgrade that, using a point spending system.","It\'s awesome! I do experience some glitches and bugs sometimes(such as the holo turret, when set on the side of something, glitches out and often floats.) Other than that, it\'s all good! Keep up the good work! Oh and if it were possible, I\'d love more customizations such as... wings/capes, new heads, armor/body and all that. Looking unique is good! ^^","Awesome game, for sure, but I have a few frustrating issues. For one, look controls become janky during raids, making aiming more difficult. Second, and this is a big one for me, there is no Undo Last function when building. We need that, because my third issue is the inconsistent move/look controls during building. Often, the sides of the screen will swap, or the input will fail and I will bore a 10-tile hole into the floor I cannot fill without consuming build points.

I bought this game when I was 10 years old and I had a lot of fun with it (4 years ago) I see a lot of people talking about difficulty and stuff but I\'m pretty sure you can change difficulty, and I never had a problem with it even when playing on normal, some levels will be hard because it\'s a strategy game not casual. (Also probably just a skill issue) Really nice storyline and great gameplay! Never bought anything except a hero either so it\'s not that hard.","Perfect Mobile Strategy Game! What a gem to find a strategy game that works well with mobile, offers decent paid upgrades buy isn\'t pay to win (the upgrades are just new captains), and a challenging series of maps as well as a TON of achievements. I just finished all the achievements and I absolutely love all easter eggs and how much was put into the game. I hope for more like it in the future. My only criticism is some of the paid captains aren\'t very good. Blue Dragon is great though!!","I really like how you can upgrade the heros and have a tech tree, I like that there are two different currency\'s in the game, I think it adds some challenge, especially if you don\'t use your coin abilitys wisely, it adds some planing to it instead of using them all over, and the bosses are challenging but beatable if you look at the patterens, overall a very good game. ( I don\'t get all the people saying they can\'t beat the bosses, I take them out quite quickly, then again I play alot)","Fantastic game design, however the difficulty curve is insane. A little too insane for my taste sadly. You end up being dependant on purchasing bombardments from the store to be able to get anywhere by the 3rd mission, but you never have enough because you have to use them so often just so you dont get overwhelmed. Not a game for casual players, and not worth the money i spent.","Honestly the game play is great and I\'m a huge fan of Ironhide games but that 4th mission, Unto The Breach, is ridiculously difficult. I tried everything multiple times, even going as far as turning the difficulty to easy but to no avail. I really wish I could get past it because I want to play the rest of the game but i guess I\'ll just stick to the kingdom rush series."],"appId":"com.ironhidegames.android.ironmarines","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ironhidegames.android.ironmarines&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.asanteegames.magicrampage":{"title":"Magic Rampage","description":"Exciting platformer that combines the RPG genre with fast-paced action gameplay.

With an ipega 9167 connected, the character will move constantly and the gamepad can only change the direction of movement, the character never stops running. No option in gamepad options to configure between joystick or d-pad for movement. Update: made screencapture report to devs, got back a cookie cutter \\"We will definitely keep an eye on this.\\" which actually means \\"we know and don\'t care.\\" so im subtracting a star.","Awesome game. If you like old-school games, then this is one of the best ones. My complaints: the first one is fire suit doesnt exactly protect you from fire attacks, the prices of items go up disproportionately and down at random moments. The items are sometimes just randomly taken out from the store. 2 stars for the ridiculously high prices and taking items out of store. Also, Some ads are mature in nature.","Overall, this game has a lot of potential. Unfortunately, the buttons often have a delayed response (specifically the jump button). It can make it extremely annoying when trying to double jump across a big gap, to get treasures or search for secret areas. Also, there should be a way to configure the button setup. To move them, reorder them, or change their size. If there is a way to do so, I\'ve yet to find it. Other than these 2 things, it\'s a great game.","I very much enjoy this game. Really old school vibe, easy controls, and secret areas to find, reminds me of the good days. The amount of gold you earn vs the costs of stuff is pretty fair, and lots of weapons, gear, and uses for each of them specifically. All in all, nothing negative to say about it! Perhaps being able to customize your character a little more than just the eye/skin color would be cool, just saying lol.","The game is actually really fun. Grinding for loot and gold isn\'t all that bad, plus it gives plenty of incentive to go back to previous levels anyway. The loot is good, it\'s fast-paced, action packed and pretty challenging. I do wish there was inventory management... I know it kind of does it automatically, but not in the order I want it. I also noticed how much easier the enemies died when I payed real money... I got a sword so good it practically forced me to change classes."],"appId":"com.asanteegames.magicrampage","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.asanteegames.magicrampage&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.lemonjamgames.neonimpact":{"title":"Neon Impact","description":"Clicker Endless RPG.

Like S&P2, adding things doesn\'t make it \\"better\\". Full of busy work and making no progress for it. Income based off of resets and not combat str, and you can\'t farm resets because cooldowns. Can\'t even farm for currency because they\'re locked behind quests that become uncompletable when airships are exhausted, or a dungeon every 10 minutes ONLINE. Gear system even @#$% than IK. Only good thing is everything accessible on 1 scrn.","The game fantastic, i dont like games like that but your game was so good but you have problem, when the game give you new things like dungeon battle or something like that, the level you unlucked in characters and all coins bot will luck, can you fix this problem and also can you make the game with google game app and add some Achievements","Ad buttons aren\'t clearly marked.

This game, not so much. You have to discard 4 of your towers every time. Desert maps cause overheat, bosses change spawn points at random, your towers always getting stunned. For me these new additions just made the game much more *infuriating*, not more fun. And there\'s not very many maps either. Wool/unlocks were fine. This game is ok, but I would pay money to get the original on Android.","Top tier tower defense game I hate spending money on games. I chose to spend a few bucks to support the developers on this one. Minimal ads. Grinding is minimal. Basically, it lacks the kind of baloney that we have all come to accept as normal for phone games. The game has a unique visual aesthetic. The towers and enemies are carried in a way that requires some strategy. The maps and worlds are varied. Ice, desert, forest. Also a mix of maps that are open or have pre set paths","Pretty decent TD game. You\'re trying to defend against aliens that are trying to kidnap the most intelligent life on Earth (sheep). So far, I have three issues with gameplay. 1) Tesla towers are supposed to attack air and ground units, but seem to only attack ground. 2) in Hard mode there is no way to earn 3 stars. a perfect game will yield 4 stars, but losing one sheep will cost your score two stars. 3) I try to get a perfect score on every map, and I am at a point in the second set of maps where I cannot get a perfect score in Hard mode, so that irks me. But, overall good game.","Can\'t play, sent crash data reports. I use a Samsung galaxy s20 and when I open the app it allows me to login with my Google play. Afterward, I select the button to start but once I select the first stage it turns off. When I close and re open the app it asks me to send crash data, which I obliged. Graphics look decent. Would love to be able to change the rating so if whatever is causing this gets patched and I\'m alerted, ill give it another try.","Just a really fun Tower Defense game... With no ads! No in-your-face micro transactions! Some of the level designs (like the desert levels) can be so challenging, in a good way, that makes you keep coming back. In my opinion, this game is up there with BloonsTD6.

So much of it was garbage, and this, while not the best quality, was very fun. Still fun today. I don\'t mind giving $6 to the creators 10 years later (don\'t actually remember how long it\'s been) after playing it for free for many hours after school. I only wish it were more difficult. They very easy strategy is to let them build up a line of units, march up to your base, and spam range. That way, all of your range (all 10ish) are firing at the same time. Doing massive damage. Good 2 hour time waster to do the campaigns. Music is great","I love the game it is something I used to play a lot however there are a couple of things that are wrong with this. First the A.I is extremely unballanced. It basically has infinite resources turned on and gets really op if u look away from the game for more than 5 seconds. 2 (this one isn\'t that bad but) the 30 second unskipable adds are a bit of a let down and I understand that the games can go on for a very long time so after each one there is an add that is ok but to not be able to skip. No","Nice and fun time killer. Overall great, but gets repetitive pretty quickly. The game does give you options but most of them you have to pay for. Also it doesn\'t feel like any previous games make any progress in the next. Like playing the same thing over and over again without any bonuses from previous victories. Beside that, everything is great. Like the design, artstyle, the general ideas of the characters and the idea of the generation shifting, Overall great game.","Not a game you keep, but definitely worth playing, for a few hours. Can be played offline, gives a lot of Google Play Achievements XP, tough only 2 of the said \'Commanders\' is free. If you\'ve never played the flash game (like me), the trick is to play defensively, until you reach the super unit, in the last age. Stay within your Towers range, don\'t unlock 4th units (to save Gold) and don\'t worry if your opponent has advanced to the next age. \'Hard\' is beatable with this simple strategy.","I really like this game. However when I played the different difficulties I found that medium was too easy and hard is still hard so there\'s no medium really, and the ai isn\'t smarter, just more op. When I also decided to buy the general mode it wouldn\'t work, so I uninstalled and installed it a few times (worked the 4th time) and it unlocked general mode but when I pressed on it, it told me to buy general mode again which is annoying. Overall this game is great just don\'t buy anything."],"appId":"com.maxgames.aow2","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.maxgames.aow2&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.noxgames.hitman.hero.arpg":{"title":"Agent Hero: Action Hitmaster","description":"There is no end to the action in this fast-paced archer like shooter RPG that pulls you straight into a world of non-stop shooting and dodging.

It\'s probably not hard to simply beat every level in some capacity, but 3 stars is nigh impossible on some levels. You don\'t get 3 stars as a reward for playing well, you get it by sheer luck or by using power ups which should not be required, especially since they are RANDOM","The destruction physics are great, I absolutely love watching the castles crumble to the ground. What gets frustrating is that you usually have attempt each level multiple times to get a 3 star score. Those grappling hooks drove me insane. I bowed out at about level 45. Fun & challenging game but there\'s no weapon selection, no story. Just destroy castles and move on & that wears thin after awhile. 4/5!!","Hook = garbage pos. I love these games but unfortunately this one requires the \\"finding one exact angle with one weapon and nothing else will finish the level\\" method on every single level which really take 99% of the fun out of it. I\'ll spend $ on a game that allows more than 1 solution. Also the tap location seems to randomly move at the start of a level, making it difficult to launch projectiles sometimes.","The game sets up rube Goldberg machine situations that don\'t actually work unless you attempt the level many times. It can be really frustrating, but is also quite fun and entertaining when you hit the right weak spot. Overall the game is enjoyable. I just hope the physics continue to get improved. Often I\'ll hit the same spot and nothing will happen, then the next attempt it hits and makes everything fall down!","Great game. There is always a way to destroy each castle so no reason to buy anything if you have patience. I finished the game with the last 25 levels easy pickings taking generally 1-3 tries to complete.

This one is great fun too. However, I absolutely cannot stand how I\'m given an option to watch an ad for extra XP at the end of each mission and if I just choose to move on, because I hate having to watch a video at the end overy single mission, I still get shown a stupid ad. So watch an ad for a bonus! Yay! Oh you don\'t want the bonus? Okay here\'s an ad still but no bonus. Thanks but no thanks. Uninstalling.","This game has a lot to like. It\'s not really for me. I hit a level where a new enemy debuffs all of my towers. Like all of them, it\'s a huge range and duration. Leveled up my towers and abilities a couple of times, but I still get crushed. It\'s not really a matter of strategy or placement, I just need to grind way more. There is a limit to how much fun that is in a Tower Defense game. Replaying the levels you can already crush over and over gets real slow and dull.","Just started playing this, finished the first 3 levels, and I really enjoy the game. Seems balanced and unique. Though it seems that there\'s no cloud backup, and there\'s no way to pay to disable ads. Ads will show up once in a while after you finish a level. I wanna get rid of them by paying, but couldn\'t find a way to do so. Definitely a good alternative for Kingdom Rush lovers out there.","First the bad, the battles can get somewhat long and tedious. Now the good, whether or not you win a battle or gain a star, even if you don\'t, you still gain some exp! Most defense games if you can\'t get through a level you have to pay....but not in this one! Keep going back into the boards you\'ve cleared and eventually you\'ll get exp. To level up and possibly enter new boards.","Does not save progress from one phone to another :( The game itself is fairly fun, but you will need to progress forward to come back and do some of the hard-mode raids. There are times when things are not explained well or the controls are a bit off, like if there are lots of dropped items it can lead to using the wrong ones. Clicking can be a litrle hard on the phone and the Galaxy Note Stylus is completely ignored by some actions you can click."],"appId":"ru.iriysoft.cursedtreasure2","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.iriysoft.cursedtreasure2&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.Roika.Darkrise":{"title":"Darkrise - Pixel Action RPG","description":"Darkrise is a classic hardcore game that was created by two indie developers in nostalgic pixel style. \\n\\nIn this action RPG game you can get acquainted with 3 characters - Alice, Godric and Kira. Everyone of them has unique skills, game mechanics and features. \\n\\nHomeland of the game heroes was invaded by undead creatures and demons. Now they have to become stronger and clean the country from invaders.\\n\\nThere are 20 location to play on and 3 difficulties. Enemies will spawn in a front of you or appear from portals that will spawn randomly on location every few seconds. All enemies are different and have their unique features. Defective enemies can appear sometimes, they have random stats and you cannot predict their powers. That is why playing Darkrise is never boring.\\n\\nFighting system is quite juicy: camera shakes, strike flashes, health drop animation, dropped items fly in sides.

Enemies will spawn in a front of you or appear from portals that will spawn randomly on location every few seconds. All enemies are different and have their unique features. Defective enemies can appear sometimes, they have random stats and you cannot predict their powers.

Wish there were more available active skills per class. Hints at the load screen are way to quick. I can never read them. There should be lists of hints in the menu. Wish there were more secrets and exploration in the individual levels. Seems like there should have been more areas you could get to within them. Otherwise, awesome!","Great game! Has the perfect amount of gear, level, money/gems grinding! Please do not increase exp. Love the mechanics! Difficulty is perfect as well! Would love to see more classes and new maps as well as newer enemies. It would be great to see visual progression with the gear we obtain so the game doesnt look so bland.","Incredibly fun. Fairly simple and easy to figure out. Just wish that the Archer\'s attack range for the auto targeting was farther. Also want a larger fov. As it is now it\'s only fine if you are a warrior. If you want range though you have to wait till they are pretty close in order to even see them. Minor annoyances. Still an amazing game.","This game was way better than I thought it was gonna be. I love old style games like this. I just got sucked into playing..I couldn\'t put it down. It gets really challenging once you get deep in it. I\'m a mage... I\'m curious to see if the other classes are also good. (I always pick mage). The in game purchases aren\'t predatory, like every other phone game out there. If I make a purchase, it\'ll be to show support for some awesome developers. Well done\ud83d\udc4d","An interesting game. No story. Just go and shoot things. Resources are liberal BUT the price of items are high. So be prepared for a lot of farming for resources and experience points. I hit a wall at about level 80 where significant time was needed to progress. I declined to spend money, so the net result was no progression."],"appId":"com.Roika.Darkrise","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Roika.Darkrise&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.loongcheer.tcg.deckadventure":{"title":"Dreaming Dimension: Deck Hero","description":"About the Game\\nDreaming Dimension: Deck Heroes is a roguelike DBG card game.

Dreaming Dimension is now released to the formal track. During the beta period, we optimized the game a lot and added Russian. We hope you can keep loving this beautiful indie game. Thanks for your support! ","comments":["It\'s really fun and a cool concept. My only big issue with it is that it should save your progress upon exiting. When I first downloaded it, I was on break at work and went through and beat the first boss, but then I had to get back on my shift and there was no option to save and exit. I hoped maybe it did it by default, but nope. I had to start all iver again. Seems like the playthroughs might be fairly long, so you shouldn\'t be obligated to sit all the way through one in one shot.","So far it\'s pretty good in the genre. Some cards are missing text after an upgrade and the menu area is kinda hard to navigate (can I just get a Talents button I don\'t have to walk to?) But overall pretty fun. Some grammar/spelling errors on one or two of the loading texts and generally slow progression toward other characters, but a well developed and fun game all in all. I\'d call it one of the best mobile options available.","The game seems ok, but most of the time each character only has one build they can run if they want to win with a specific character. It was fun, but a couple things annoyed me. First of all, half of the characters you can\'t even unlock without buying them with real money. I wish they would have given you the choice between a lot of in-game money or real money if you want to speed it up. Second, I don\'t get why they make the easier difficulties harder when there are harder ones already.","The game always crashes at the loading screen, it\'s also laggy & slow. The game looks similar to vs fight, in that game I was among the top players, if this game is any similar it should be very awesome. It\'s the only reason I\'m willing to give it a try. My only concern is the talent, relic & equipment. These sort of things remove power from cards & dilute strategy making the game more about levels & what upgrades/items you have over the enemy. Vs fight is no longer functional now cause of p2w.","Was playing fine a week ago. Game was fun and challenging esp. after unlocking the hidden boss per level. That was fine. But when I played this week, it keeps on lagging when I select different areas in the screen. Also after defeating certain enemies. I checked my internet connection but it was fine. The problem seems to be in-game. Hopefully the devs will look into it."],"appId":"com.loongcheer.tcg.deckadventure","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.loongcheer.tcg.deckadventure&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.funstudio.dungeonheroes":{"title":"Dungeon: Age of Heroes","description":"Embark on a dangerous and exciting adventure across the fantastic kingdom of Jatran.

Sadly though the game heavily relies on ads. Not just from screens, but being able to progress your character. Very slow advancement with increasing diffuculty promotes purchases to get anywhere. On the plus side, the graphics are top notch. The world map style is fantastic. The music is wonderful. Otherwise the game is virtually unplayable without money.","It\'s a pretty fun game. There are some things that could be fixed: the first or second line of the tutorial doesn\'t make sense, the description of the small health potion is incomplete, and the biggest issue is that enemies only agro if you are in a square to the left/right/up/down of them which allows one of your abilities to damage enemies without them noticing. I can kill bosses way above my level without taking damage.","I like this game. Good design, entertaining. The one problem I have is with the inventory system. I have items but I can\'t add them to my character. I have 3 rings of dodge but can\'t use them. Under the item screen, I try to click on an item and does nothing. I couldn\'t change items during adventures. I just can\'t give the game 5 stars because of the inventory management. Otherwise good game.","It started out good, even having to go through annoying ads to gain more crystals and gold was mildly acceptable. But now I have everything I could find on the map conquered, and its just now boring. I am looking forward to new dungeons. Could complete only one of the three Lair of Evil dungeons, to stsge 34, and the other two to stsges 36. Load progress would show 0% for some time, then revert back to map. I do like the game though. Keep up the good work!","Pros: Nice music and backdrop. You feel like your in a dungeon. Cons: im going to nitpick: all the other characters are behind a pay wall. Don\'t get me wrong, bills have to be paid (I\'m not going to knock a person\'s ability to get the bag). You can unlock them through watching ads (and they give you a discount if you unlock all if them at once with real money; not sure if that\'s for a limited time or not), so they understand.

The cut scene art style is subpar, and the dialogue translation is rough... But I\'m already fond of the combat mechanics and stat system. Hell, if someone translated the native language first, I\'d happily just clean it up myself! I\'m interested to see the direction this game takes. A solid investment of time, at the very least.","Excellent game! Progress is just hard enough to be satisfying, but not so hard that it\'s discouraging. My only complaint is the limited skillset. There are four skills and four masteries per character, but they top out pretty quickly with no further improvement opportunities. It keeps the game simple though, so I suppose that\'s a trade-off. All told, I applaud the developers. Well done, chaps, well done.","This is one of the best mobile games I\'ve played in a long time. The story is exciting and engaging, and their add system is optional-watch an add to get a prize or double your gold. Everything is doable without spending $$$. More challenging levels are available after you beat normal. Like them on Facebook and get a coupon to get a great welcome package too!","I haven\'t played the game for very long yet, however it does seem to have a interesting and decent story up to where I am. the controls are pretty standard as similair games go, I prefer the joystick to be stationary and the combat system is a little different but not necessarily in a bad way. You run around a defined area attacking the enemies that are presented. Overall it isna fun game and I do enjoy the anime stylings. Good job developers. :)","I really enjoy the story. But sadly can\'t go back and re-read it if i am trying to show it to anyone. It had a skip option first time through so I assumed if I went back to any mission I could read or skip the story but nope. Also the story does not reflect difficulty while playing, if you had a tough time with a level having to retry many times they might still say it was easy in the story. I am currently stuck on a boss, and the grind is getting wearing without any story."],"appId":"com.gacogames.epiccon","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gacogames.epiccon&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.EvoTApps.GameOfEvolution":{"title":"Game of Evolution: Idle Clicker & Merge Life","description":"Human evolution is fun!\\nMake your way from an ameba to space traveling.

Very colorful, adorable, and surprising creatures show up and it doesn\'t take too long to progress through the ages/eras. Haven\'t fully reached the space part yet but so far I am addicted! The ads are not excessive and mostly there\'s some form of reward for watching AND if the video glitches...you get the reward anyway! THAT\'S how ya get a 5 star rating \ud83d\ude06 Looking at you, Covet Fashion \ud83d\ude44 I love a game that doesn\'t take literally YEARS to hit level 5. Nice game! P.S. it\'s ELON Musk \ud83d\ude06","Lovin\' this game! I\'ve always been a big fan of evolution-based games and this one quickly became a favorite. Very easy to spend hours playing. The best part is that the ads are optional...they dont pop up every 30 seconds like they do in most other free games these days! Kudos to the developers! *Only had 1 problem: when I moved the game storage to my SD card it wouldn\'t open, it just kept crashing. Once I realized what the problem was and moved it back to internal storage everything was OK.","I thought this game was going to end when we reached the modern era. But the game goes beyond that, into outer space. Aliens! I like that... Why 4 stars? Some ad offers automatically try to open the download page after the ad finishes playing, though I tap on the X. I don\'t know if it\'s done on the app\'s side or if it\'s how the advertiser set it up. It gets kind of frustrating at times.","Gameplay is ok, and the characters are cute. There are a couple of super annoying things though: sometimes lifesparks spawn or drift behind the on-screen menu buttons and you can\'t tap on them until they drift back out. And the other thing is when you\'re tapping on a character that earns more coins and another, lower value character drifts in front of it. You have to keep dragging your character away from the other characters so you get the most coins per tap.","Addictive! Love it.

Kind of retro and easy moving. Good for relaxing with, but not TOO easy. Still requires a little strategy and attention. Not the same old same old. Edit: i have beaten the game on normal and am trying difficult level. It is very challenging now. Advanced players need not worry that the game is too easy now. In fact I\'m not sure i can beat it on the harder setting, it\'s tough! (but still fun).","This is a fantastic game! Great depth in both story and gameplay. The strategy is simple with enough elements to make it challenging. Incorporating a time, terrain, resource, stamina, and skill system that makes it easy to understand without being boring. I was addicted right away, couldn\'t stop playing, and didn\'t have to pay anything to complete. You should play this game too. Go Griblers!","No ads. Absolutely free. Others have accurately described the game. I just wanted to add my voice to confirm that this is completely ad free. The developers give you the option about five or six times (after completing key missions) to donate $2 if you are enjoying the game. (I think they called it upgrading to premium, but it was really just giving you the chance to donate. The complete game is free.) I finished it without having to spend a penny (after which I paid the $2 because was worth it)","Really really fun game. No p2w at all. Cool concept and really responsive developers. Few things I would suggest would be: Automation to make tasks easier. Like being able to set a destination and Gribler makes it automatically. Replaying the mini text rpg. I clicked skip by mistake and couldn\'t solve it. Maybe a mine in the tree city just like we have a farm.","if you like counting every third turn and constantly managing inventory then boy oh boy is this the game for you. I\'m pretty surprised at the rating for this game. It\'s super simplistic, it makes you change characters every few steps, and you are in Perpetual Inventory management mode a good deal of the time because they throw a million items at you and give you a limited set of expandable but still Limited inventory slots. Exactly the opposite kind of game I like.

When you watch an ad it immediately brings you to the play store and when you try and go back to the game it restarts the game. I was almost at the end of a level and I died so I watched an ad (easy way out I know) and this happened to me and made me do the whole level over again, which pretty much defeats the purpose of the ad, huh. Other than that great game, a little laggy sometimes but that might just be my phone.","I love this game. The graphics are great, the characters are cool, the bikes are cool, and the guns are cool. My only big problem is that when you progress in the game, there\'s a lot of objects, that can kill you, in the way (porta john\'s, fireballs, dumpsters). Don\'t get me wrong, there should be obstacles in the way, but there\'s almost a ridiculous amount of them. Other than that, great game \ud83d\udc4d\u270c\ufe0f","Fantastic, Simple, Addictive fun. As a fan of heavily-stylized games like CounterSpy, TF2, and the like, this game is a breath of fresh air from the usual stuff on the app store from the art style alone. As for its gameplay, this game plays a lot like early racing games like OutRun with plenty of unique enviroments, vehicles, weapons and characters. You can only use your gun at select moments, but when you do, its pretty cool. On top of all that, running over dead people gets you $. 10/10 lol","It has enough mechanics to keep it interesting. Some of it could easily be better like the shooting and bimb throwing. If you made it so that you actually have to aim, itd add a skill requirement and give the game more difficulty and potential for different difficulty levels. Other stuff is way too easy too, and the game focuses a bit on being monetizable, like alot of mobile games. Those things hold it back, but it\'s core gameplay isnt bad & it could easily be improved on to make it way better.","Great game, very satisfying to play. Been playing for just a day and felt compelled to spend $2 to remove ads. It\'s not that the ads were obnoxious either, just that it\'s such a good game I didn\'t want any down time between runs lol. Well worth a shot for free. No need to spend anything if you dont want. To the developers though, there was one small technical issue for me. The sounds have quite a disparity in volume. Adding seperate sliders to music and FX would be great."],"appId":"com.makabaka.hellrider3","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.makabaka.hellrider3&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.weirdjohnny.idle.rpg":{"title":"Hero Tale - Idle RPG","description":"Adventure of the boy on the medieval fantasy island.\\nBeat enemies to become stronger, loot items from them and customize your equipment fitting to your strategy.

First, while it\'s supposed to be an idle game you must pay $10 to buy the \\"Caretaker\\" for that privilege. Second, everything is attached to 30sec-1min ads which is another $10 to buy the \\"nibbler\\" to remove, which leads to the third issue of the constant push for that purchase every few ads. Fourth, it is possible to permanently mess up a schools evaluations with no ability to fix","Love it, pretty fun! Dont even mind the ads on this 1 really (even if there are a TON if you want to progress quickly.) The problem is the app keeps crashing on me, most often after I\'ve watched an ad (and oc i dont get a reward for completeing those.) Two times I\'ve gone back to find it didnt even autosave the last minute or so. Which doesnt seem like a lot but then i have to rewatch ads or something to get the money back. So yea, love it but pls fix it.","very high quality gameplay, very enjoyable, doesn\'t bombard you with ads unless you\'re going to earn something from it. removal of ads is reasonably priced. game is able to be finished within a month or two depending on the amount you play, but if you don\'t play often, it lasts a long time. it\'s also still im development, with new colleges being added.","This game has cute graphics and neat looking wizards/witches to level up and gear up, but the game has too little of content and I found myself not having any goals to accomplish. I hold the top rank at over 880k wizard tower score but find the game to be too boring even as an idle game. I completed 90% of content in the first two weeks. Months of grinding had lead to no new content.The final level appears to be false hope as it seems the developers have abandoned the game. Would not recommend.","I\'ll give it a solid 4, very cool game and I just finished watching Harry Potter series which is kinda funny. My only problem is, is that it isn\'t the developers problem really more or so my phone\'s problem because my camera was put on the screen so I can\'t see how much gold I have, I hope the developers see this and hopefully change where the gold and other things are placed because if I had to guess other people who have the same phone deal with the same problem.

Only thing I want is a more in-your-face story, it\'s kind of just passersby at the moment and I liked it in Half-Life, I can definitely grow to like it here.","I absolutely love the first game and it made me get into this pixel rpg genre, and when I saw this game on my suggested I couldn\'t believe it. The first Game holds a special place in my heart and I hope this game is as good if not goes beyond my expectations of the first game.","This game is a real gem! Very satisfying on-screen controls.

Its really fun gameplay and with all of the classes to choose from and master, there\'s always something you can do differently. The one complaint I have is optimization. Whenever a ton of enemies are on screen, or when a lot of magic effects are visible, the game lags unbearably. Please add resolution modifiers or something, just to make gameplay past 25 minutes actually playable. Other than that, everything is perfect.","Huge fan for years now! Love the update with new magic, artifacts, and abilities, it was definitely due. If you like upgrading and exploring different fighting styles this is for you. This is slow to start, then exponentially increases with difficulty but so does your characters abilities. There is a point where defense matters more then offense. I\'ve tried both ways and still can only last 20-30 min average. The story is slightly convoluted. 1 ad for 1 revive is nice. Best played w/ stylus pen.","One of the best phone games. Very limited adds. Rogue-Like \\"Asteroids\\" game. The joystick control takes a bit to get used to and master, but try the different joy-stick options to find the best for you. The developer seems invested, or was when I was playing this game heavily. Lots to unlock, and you\'ll easily be entertained for 20-60 minutes per run.","This is such a refreshing take on the infinite survivor. The core loop of leveling up, gaining new spells, and finding items is addicting. The spell evolutions are great & offer a lot of possibilities, especially with the new system they recently implemented, removing the need to sacrifice a spell to evolve another. The ads arn\'t too annoying & removing them is very reasonably priced. If you have played Vampire Survivor, this is right up your alley.","Kind of miss the old feature of combining two maxed out skills into a superpower, didn\'t get much time exploring that, also think the fireball looked a bit better before it was changed. Overall, really great game, tho. Love the different builds you can come up with, and how op you can get. I kinda think it would be fun to have a map with no level cap, just cause I want to try and get all of everything.

The only thing I\'d say should be added is a feature to see what an item in your inventory can be used to craft, so that you don\'t have to search each crafter looking for how to use a rare item taking up inventory space","Absolutely wonderful, this is a game for the hard core and casual players. If you want to grind for the best gear possible be ready to buckle down to the grind. I love the hero selection and all the different monsters and materials I get to fight and collect. The game can feel repetitive at times but you have more than enough content over time to have fun. However, I do wish there where more heros add to the game over time becouse that does get a bit boring once you have reached a certain point","I personally found it a bit tedious after a while, but the core concept is fun. It just got to a point where I had like 10 heroes, and manually assigning them every few minutes wasn\'t fun. The game tries to do a lot of things okay, whereas if l could just focus on one piece I might enjoy it more. Managing the shop was not nearly as fun as watching the heroes get stronger, but it\'s a bit barebones. Good, just not great.","Quite the fun time waster. There is always something to do here and you will quickly lose count of how long you\'ve spent playing. Training heroes while running a shop was a really fun interaction for a while, but it seemed to cut off pretty abruptly (I never prestiged them). Great if you have a lot of spare time, but can be a huge time sink otherwise.","I don\'t think I\'ve had a bad experience either time I\'ve played this game, especially since aside from the actual DLC, you can reasonably access everything with in game currency. And the fact that anything I buy is permanently mine is (unfortunately) refreshing. The art is great, the prices feel worth it, and the game so far feels like they put a lot of love into this.

It\'s simple, cathartic, linear. But now it is almost unplayable through the ads. Every time I open the shop or click a box, I cringe knowing there\'s a 75% chance it\'s going to pop up an ad. Not only that, but the banner ads create a huge amount of lag on my phone and on my chromebook. They broke the game to make money.","I wish I could rate this 4.5 stars. This game is fun and addicting! The prestige option makes the game fun. The mystery box is a great addition to the game. The special mines are fun also. There are few ads. There is one problem though, the in-app purchases do not work. If this problem gets fixed, I will remove the part about the problem and rate this game 5 stars.","I am addicted to this game! It\'s the simplest of all game models but something about it is just so satisfying. One improvement I would like to see is an option to turn off Mystery Boxes. Mystery Boxes tend to give the player a clutter of gems, being able to turn this off would create an even greater challenge to achieving a higher \\"score\\".","This could be a great game. A few issues though... To do any kind of upgrade you have to watch an ad. I don\'t have a problem with watching ads but you can\'t always watch an ad with one click. Multiple clicks are required and most times you can\'t view the ad so you get no upgrade. I\'ve tried to purchase \\"ad free\\" but it doesn\'t work. I\'ve emailed the developers and get zero response.","Overall I like this game, the graphics are simple and pretty, and it\'s a great time waster. However I have had some issues with it recently, the game doesn\'t fit my screen correctly with parts too close or even partially off the screen, and the achievements like to bug out, making duplicates that dont advance in progress."],"appId":"com.gramgames.london.mergegems","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gramgames.london.mergegems&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.mergegame.merge":{"title":"Merge Inn - Tasty Match Puzzle","description":"Have you visited the cozy Merge Inn?

If an ad doesn\'t load, it still counts against you and you can\'t watch another ad to get the energy bonus (or other bonuses), sometimes the game will freeze and I have to relaunch the app, but this usually happens when I\'m watching an ad, so again I don\'t get the bonus and I\'ve wasted my time. I was able to live with getting limited ads for bonuses, but when everything freezes or gets glitchy I don\'t really want to play anymore.","I like this merge game a lot more than some others out there. I feel that with the clubs, the timer between asking for energy is a bit much unless you set a timer to go on. About 25% of the adds glitch and then won\'t let you retry to get either the energy or food item. Decent game if you can deal with it \ud83d\udc4d but could definitely fix a few things","Very addictive! Just really like this game. P.s. to those that can\'t get enough play time-watch a few very short videos! To those that worked so hard on this game \ud83c\udf89 keep up the great work! 8/22/2022 update: I really like this game but it does nothing but cheat me now! Ever since the update for \\"clubs\\" it crashes continuously and when it\'s not crashing it lags so very bad. Please fix it! I don\'t want to have to find another game...","Best of these types of games I\'ve played so far. More lenient storage options, ability to watch ads to get more energy a few times a day. The new clubs are why I\'ve taken a star..I\'ll return it when they\'re not so buggy. Can\'t give energy to people I know I haven\'t yet, but says I gave them energy (they\'ve gotten zero help yet, yet I can\'t help them?)","The ads are glitchy and you only get so many. Alright, still a good game. I enjoyed playing it. Then the game just stopped giving me ads. I cannot get more energy to play with. This makes things incredibly tedious. I\'m probably going to uninstall. Also! The Mint side event is very stressful. It\'s timed, so it feels like I should work on that instead. But it takes too much energy and doesn\'t give enough back."],"appId":"com.mergegame.merge","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mergegame.merge&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.wjoy.witch":{"title":"Merge Witches-Match Puzzles","description":"Are you looking for merge games, puzzle games, free games, girls games? \\nThen \\"Merge Witches\\" will surely be a great target for you!\\n\\nThere was a peaceful and mysterious sky city, where the cute witches lived a calm life.

Pros: they add new regular levels and special challenges often, you get some gems playing, you can have fun without having to spend money or connect with \\"friends,\\" and the interface isn\'t too overwhelming. Cons: it takes up a lot of space and takes forever to load initially, the camp quests take literal months of daily play to complete one sequence (the books, omg), and some of the special level types are duds. But overall fun if this is your type of thing.","I love this game. The graphics are super cute and there is plenty to keep busy with. My one issue is space...and I have paid to unlock extra space. I have so many bubbles accumulated that hold items I don\'t have space for and I don\'t want to just keep getting rid of everything but all those accumulated items sitting there irritates me. I\'m not new to merge games but maybe I\'m missing something in this one that is the cause of me not opening space a little faster?","It\'s a cute game, but actual game PLAY is very limited due to the characters (witches) have only enough energy to do about 3 or 4 activities before they must sleep. That\'s it, 3, maybe 4 things if you\'re lucky, then they\'re out of commission for a while unless you\'re willing to pay to wake them up. You do have islands to explore, but the cost of each exploration is fairly high considering the exploration lasts mere seconds, then you\'re on to the next one, paying another exorbitant price.","This is a fun game and I enjoy it, but it would be great if the witches didn\'t sleep all the time. Makes progress very slow when only one or two witches are awake at a time. Or you have to pay to wake up a witch to harvest. That could definitely be improved upon. Update: After playing this game for awhile, the game is even better. So much to do! Takes awhile to build the game up, but well worth it. Love the games. Just wish we could keep the eggs we win in the games along with coins.","Update: after playing for several days I\'ve found plenty to do to keep one busy for at least 20 minutes. I really like the separate merge levels the best...Just loaded this app, played 5 minutes and apparently can\'t do anything for 20 minutes as the witches are sleeping. I will be uninstalling if thats the way it continues. I\'ll give it a day then decide."],"appId":"com.wjoy.witch","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wjoy.witch&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.sanctumstudio.mochicat":{"title":"Mochicats Collection","description":"Mochicats are carefree and enjoy eating and playing around. \\n\\nThey can eat as much dessert as you feed them, like they will never get enough of it! \\n\\nThey also love making new friends!

Plays well, it\'s fun, addictive, and definitely relaxing to me. However, I don\'t know what\'s been happening with the ads, but they sometimes make the game crash. I\'ve had my phone forcefully restart twice because of them. I have to spam my fingers all over the screen to hopefully prevent it. Aside from that scary inconvenience, it\'s an overall good game with good mochi buddies.","It\'s cute! You can\'t really play it 24/7 but it\'s great for when you\'re awkwardly sitting in public or are bored at home. It\'s easy to learn and the ads aren\'t long, nor does it force you to watch them. A few minor bugs I\'ve experienced a couple times like things being misplaced or not responding to touch but changing tabs in game fixes it. I love the art style a lot and mindless tapping games help my anxiety \ud83d\udc95","This game is so adorable! I love how it doesn\'t blast you with ads like most games these days. Ads are more a tool for bonus rewards, IF you want it, such I love. All of the interaction with the cats is cute, progress is as fast as you want it to be, and you can play for a long time without the game kicking you out for lack of energy. If I were to have one critique, maybe I would say that the UI is a bit busy and sometimes they overlap with each other which makes it hard to see what\'s going on.","This game is great and very fun/easy to play, although i do have one complaint. I believe your friend system may be broken. Me and my other friend who plays this game have tried sending friend requests multiple times, but we never seem to receive them. It\'s kind of a letdown and i really hope you can fix this soon. It seems like a simple fix, really. So far, this is the only bug i\'ve come across! Keep up the great work.","Due to the new update the game is unplayable for me it just crashes nonstop, quite disappointed in that. I just installed it 2 days ago and then it started crashing after I updating. Currently will be at 2 stars until it is fixed. On another note the design of the cats during the game play I was able to do are so adorable. I just wish I could play it without the crashing."],"appId":"com.sanctumstudio.mochicat","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sanctumstudio.mochicat&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.gg.moduleTd":{"title":"Sci-Fi Tower Defense Module TD","description":"Are you looking for a tower defense offline game with thrilling td strategy gameplay?\\nDo you want this td defense to also be an offline game so you can play it anywhere with no data / no wifi?\\n\\nTry Module TD \u2013 the best td game in the td defence genre.

If you can\'t progress without paying, you just don\'t understand the game. Ignore the ads, wait 30 seconds, and get the cash you need to upgrade. I suggest you play the normal mode on all levels, use your cash to upgrade until you\'re stuck. Then go back to level 1 and play hard mode until you\'re stuck. This gives you enough money to upgrade towers and continue to progress on normal. Rinse and repeat. You must strive for 3 stars on each level. Great game! Story is silly...","Good relaxing true tower defense. With plenty of strategy and kickin graphics. Also adding the pause button allows time to strategies upgrades. Instead of tapping my fingers off. Over all, it\'s a well put together game. Only reason i could not give it 5 stars. Is due to the fact that I could only find one way to perfect each level so far. But even so, thanks for an awesome tower defense game.","It\'s a fun tower defence game, albeit pretty hard. I came across a game breaking bug though-when I tap the screen to start some levels, it zooms in just slightly and then doesn\'t let me scroll to the buttom parts of the map where I need to place towers. Most maps work fine fine when it does it but I\'m on level 38 and it\'s impossible to pass. I don\'t know if this game gets updated anymore but I\'m hoping it does to fix this, I was really enjoying it.","This game is pretty fun. The devs did a great job on the graphics, the level designs, the sci fi aesthetic, and the upgrade system. It can be frustratingly challenging, but also rewarding when you finally beat a tough level. The only thing that\'s lacking is a better description of the powerups (English not their first language, but they usually try).","Overall the game is good. The mechanics are clean, the graphics are good, the responsiveness is decent, the content is what you would expect of a typical tower defense. The downside is the eventuality of forced MTX. You get to a certain point in the game where it is damn near unbeatable and begins to feel like a waste of time. Progression is stunted by the extreme difficulty escalation early on. Just another throw-away app at the end of the day. Had fun, but I refuse to contribute to a p2w game."],"appId":"com.gg.moduleTd","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gg.moduleTd&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.dungeon.rpg.freeherowars":{"title":"Monster Dungeon:Hunting Master","description":"Hero, the world is shattering, it\u2019s time to head to the RPG world, start your adventure to eliminate all monsters to bring the peace back to the world.\\nNow we represent the Monster Dungeon:Hunting Master to all the people who are enthusiastic for RPG, it is an idle MMORPG game with addicting gameplays and endless raid and dungeon, no time to more talk, just come and have a try.\\n\\nIn Monster Dungeon:Hunting Master, you will play as a lone hero to fight against creepy monsters in the desolate land, head to the raid and start your own adventure, it will be a unique and dramatic journey.

Weeeeellllll maybe cuz of the music.","Yeah, this is like dungeon chronicles., but so far i like the graphics .hopefully you do much better than the original. having a save data is a must .and more weapons to choose aside from Sword/gun/staff. or have a subclasses and have a character customization aside from costumes. but this is just a suggestions only.. I think this game will be more interesting in the future ..\ud83e\udd70","Do the sacred objects have any use? Is the only way to get red gems is to use REAL money?

I\'ve been finding myself last in this game for hours. And most of those hours are forced ads as you unlock new areas. I didn\'t mind them at first but after awhile it got very annoying, so I ended up buying the wolf skin which comes with ad free. Ad free lasted maybe 10 minutes or less to then BOOM, smacks me with an ad. Kinda pissed me off and unfortunately I don\'t think I wanna play it anymore.","Updated the game and it completely reset all of my progress. I was on world 3, which starts on a beach but was stuck on getting coins so I tried traveling back to world 2 but the boat that connects the two areas there was gone and so I couldn\'t mine to get gold so I decided to update and see if that would help. Worst mistake ever. I\'ve been playing this game on and off for while and having everything reset to the beginning has ruined it for me.","This game is very fun! Biggest down side is how often it crashes. The longest I have gone without a crash is 5 minutes. I don\'t mind the ads but evertime I get an ad it makes the game crash. If you watch an ad for items it\'ll make the game crash 90% of the time. Some times the control of the character will get stuck and you can\'t make him stop going that direction then it crashes after your character gets eaten by sharks. If your able to put up with all of it, it\'s a very fun game.","The game is fun no joke but there\'s WAY to many ads. Almost after every group of chopping/mining something for supplies it gives a short ad. AND there\'s a box of free supplies that pops up on the ground at times that wants you watch a ad in order to open it. It\'s annoying to have so many ads everywhere and it really disturbs the fun to have ads pop up every 30 seconds.","Update: Started playing again and it is having lots of glitching, freezing and crashing going on! Makes it almost impossible to enjoy. NEEDS 2 B FIXED!! (April 2022) Great for mindless down time! It\'s fun, and the new skins and dungeons are nice. I wish we could access them without being online however. There\'s too many ads to really have fun unless you\'re offline. Ads are good to get extra supplies, but every few seconds or after crafting every new land section?

While unique, I feel like I\'ve heard the story before, but I can\'t figure out where. The game has something to offer, it stays with you. The visuals are amazing, they give a pixeled, gamey setting, but calming music. The music gets less calm the more you go on, making it more curious. The characters are present, they\'re interesting to listen to. In the end, you miss it, but the story can\'t continue.","This game.. in the beginning... it was cute. It was simple. It was challenging. It was good. The items got me addicted honestly. But then.. in the end.. with that twist.. then it got deep. And then it was even better. Totally got me. And there are still more achievements to unlock afterwards. I love this game. If there were more levels or a similar game by these creators, I would totally play it. 10/10 would play again.","Best game ever. Not only is the music good, but the gameplay is smooth and polished, in addition to the story and unexpected turn on events that unfold. I must say though, some levels do rely on a bit of luck (such as out of sight shooty thingies), but overall while it was frustrating I personally didn\'t mind them too much. I finished the game with all cat foods, I only noticed they have a use for them at the end unfortunately xD The ending was amazing.","While it\'s very fun and well put together, I do have a few gripes. It feels like a lot of the puzzles require you to know all the gimmicks beforehand, and that there are a lot of things left to chance. Level 3-14 serves as excellent example of both of these, as it was unclear where to go after pressing down the button, and the fan had 50-50 a chance of killing the player.","Its a decent platformer with some flaws. One thing is the momentum will kill you more than anything else. You can barely change your momentum when you\'re in the air. Also I have found some bugs: - immediately going into a flower after bouncing off of a sideways mushroom can result in upwards momentum as if it were vertical. - the moveable blocks in world 2 that you can switch places with are invisible (excepted the blue arrow above it), idk if it\'s intentional."],"appId":"com.kotobagames.namelesscat","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kotobagames.namelesscat&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.chillyroom.zhmr.gp":{"title":"Otherworld Legends","description":"\\"The best warriors from different times and spaces are summoned to the mirage created by Asurendra.

It\'s fun and challenging making you think about how to tackle certain situations. The Kung Fu girl is the first and only character you get for free. Her kit is simple, fast, and strong. You can playthrough the game with just her. The other characters are to be payrd for and offer a different set of stats and mechanics for fighting. I recommend giving it a try. It won\'t hurt \ud83d\udc4d\u2728","Love this game. Each characters have several skills that you can choose one from which is really cool. The con is in higher difficulties you have to be mobile and have lots of Crowd Control because unflinchable elites can chase you down and destroy you. IMBA mode is where it\'s really fun because you get 2 skills plus you can equip all the artifacts and certain combos are devastating. Major con is it has Multi-player but I never see anybody on, and my phone seriously lags when too much goes on","have played this game for over 2 years now, I\'ve seen it grow and change and I have to say I am still looking forward to an update drop and a new character to play. The combat for each character is unique and items can be combined in fun ways you can learn to experiment with. The pixel art and animation is also amazing. For the flaws of the game the new online feature can be rough at times. Finding or setting up a room can at times be impossible. Also I\'ve had multiple games lag out well into.","Very fun game and replayable. The only reason for not being 5 star is because the Online multi-player definitely needs some work. Can\'t create sessions, so therefore can\'t find any sessions. Then when you rarely do, the session times out or horrendous lag ruins the experience. My only complaint. The currency and gameplay are heavy free to play thankfully.","A fun, free roguelike! Reminiscent of a lot of great games, like Risk of rain 2 and Dead cells! The first few difficulties are easy to beat, but Real mirage is exponentially harder. It\'s nice that once you get to that point, there are stillore things to do, and you won\'t get bored trying over and over again to beat the hardest difficulty. Rarely crashes or lags out. Beautiful art and ost ect ect. The only problem I have is that characters are behind a paywall.

The game is amazing, and really requires advanced strategy. The people complaining that the game gives you bad cards and takes away good ones don\'t realize the cards will always work well if you use them strategically and study card patterns of advanced enemies. The game gets harder as you go on, which is great. But it takes a lot of brainpower. So if it isn\'t a game for you, don\'t leave a bad review just because it\'s not a good match.","One of the best games I\'ve ever had the pleasure of playing. Visuals simple yet lovely and fantastic. Plenty of free collectibles such as gameplay buffs, cosmetics, and even hidden lore if you\'re into that. The gameplay is a perfect concoction of simple cards that turn into large and everchanging scenarios which grow in difficulty as you progress. Fun enough to love, addicting enough to keep my attention. Can even be played offline. Purchases are nice and not intrusive like other mobile apps.","Hi! Got into the game again after a long break from my \\"no comment\\" 5 stars. Just one thing to say now. If a ad plays and you click out, there is a chance that the music will start up again and will layer over the one already playing. You can stack this glitch by clicking out and back in. Note: I deleted my save data to get a fresh start for the changes since the review of 1/30/2021.","One of my favorites. It\'s a simple, yet very good, unique deck builder. Haven\'t found another like it. The ads aren\'t bad nor very long. Can be a little slow going because you need to remember what the opponent is playing but it gets better the more you play. The skins are nice but too expensive for my taste. I will spend the $4.99 that basically \\"buys\\" the game and a few extras. But I\'m still a little confused what the 15.99, 11.99, and 9.99 skin packages offer out side of character costume?","The game\'s pretty fun and decently complex, and I love the dark aesthetics. However, I don\'t know if it\'s a fault of my device or not, but the font of the texts in-game are way too big. Often getting cut off at the side or bottom of my screen, or the words are getting cut, and the remaining letters are being forced down another line. Could there be a way to fix this? Maybe an option to adjust text size? Cause it\'s obvious to me that this game wasn\'t standardized for English."],"appId":"com.phantomrosegame.phantomRoseScarlett","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.phantomrosegame.phantomRoseScarlett&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.d3p.mpq":{"title":"MARVEL Puzzle Quest: Hero RPG","description":"MARVEL Puzzle Quest is the original Match 3 Super Hero Game!

I think the devs need to change the points system on the story challenges. When you replay a match after the opponents level goes up should should get more points not less. Or start the opponent at a higher level and get the full points than work your way down. Lower level=less points, not higher level=less points.","Pros: Game consistantly adds new characters. Its allowed me to get more familiar with lesser known Marvel characters. If you continue to play over the years (I\'m on year 7), then the game doesn\'t really cost anything to play because you can get all of the resources that you need for free. They (designers) keep a repetitive color matching puzzle game interesting. Cons: It a repetitive color matching puzzle game. In the beginning it will cost newer players money if they want to keep up.","Great game, but they\'ve made a lot of missteps. They\'ve corrected nearly all the GUI issues from before, but now they\'ve changed certain events where only specific characters can be used. This shuts everyone from progressing in the game unless they\'ve collected and leveled up the required characters. It may be an attempt to make people pay money to purchase the required characters. I have no issue spending money on a game that I enjoy, however I don\'t like the idea of pay to win.","I played this awhile ago and uninstalled it after a few days. I came back again recently and ended up starting over rather than wherever Ieft off. I started to play and seemed fun at the beginning, but then I went to the subreddit and started to research how to level, best characters, etc. From what I\'ve read, if going the F2P route it is SUPER grindy, and will take years to get to end game level. I am starting to recall why I uninstalled a couple of years ago now, and I think I\'ll do it again.","I\'ve been playing this game for years. It is so hard to get the actually covers you really want/need without paying. There should be a way where you can do a \\"one time\\" swap or a system to swap out covers for other similar covers. For examples 3 stars for 3 stars, 4 stars for 4 stars and 5 stars for 5 stars. There are to many covers and I\'m constantly getting the same ones. For some of us who don\'t play versus or play casually. It is almost impossible to get what you want/need.

If you notice a bug, please contact us via support@quadline.ikovalov.com","comments":["After finishing the game I\'m revising my review. The crossroads were enjoyable since they had some genuine challenging levels but still solvable. Overall sleak, clean, and fun. Bonus levels were hit-or-miss in terms of difficulty. I\'m nitpicky with the difficulty but overall well thought out and developed game. Cons: ads became a bit obnoxious, when offline ads sometimes go black, when offline unlocking bonus levels achievement is unattainable and doesn\'t get awarded when back online.","Wonderful game! I beat the majority of it in less than 2 hours, besides the bottom right of the bonus levels, which took over half an hour of its own. It\'s unique yet simple, so I really enjoyed it! I wouldn\'t says its overall challenging (besides that one level), so I\'d definitely say others should try it out!","Really enjoyed playing through this game. There\'s a good range of difficulty and the game does an excellent job of introducing new mechanics. One thing I would love to see in the future is a level editor, due to the format of the game I think having user- made levels would be huge. I found ads to be a little intrusive but not overbearing.","Amazing puzzle game. Simple, but tough and can get pretty complex at times. Really works out your brain. My only complain is that it was sort of short, since I beat it all and got all achievements in only 2 days, so I hope some more content gets added someday. Also the bottom right level in the \\"bonus levels\\" section was the only truly annoying level in the game, to the point that I just spammed the squares until it clicked. 10/10.","Good puzzles, but after a while, you start getting long three part ads after every other puzzle, and the puzzles are quite short. This means more time watching ads then doing puzzles. I get it, ads are necessary in a free to play game, but too many and you drive players like me, who quite enjoy the game, away."],"appId":"com.IvanKovalov.quadline.android","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.IvanKovalov.quadline.android&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.roasterygames.smartphonetycoon2":{"title":"Smartphone Tycoon 2","description":"Welcome to \xabSmartphone Tycoon 2\xbb!

Generally games have that many adds to try and force the play to pay to get rid of the adds or because they prefer add income over players. I truly love the game but between the bugs and the fact I can\'t play 3 mins, I need to uninstall..","Really good start but definitely needs some work. Every minute there is 3 back to back ads, also there is a few basic phone features that you have to pay for each individually. Settings menu doesn\'t work, phone creation interface is a bit glitchy at times. With some work could be a very good game.","Great concept but seems under developed for a couple reasons. 1. Many spelling and grammatical errors. I have no problem with grammar until it becomes too much. If you want to create a game for English speakers or one that translates to English please have an English speaker check it. 2. I can be successful without fans. Bad reviews don\'t hinder sales and that makes the game a little boring after the 2nd or 3rd phone. It\'s a great concept, but not a good execution. Just the same game as the 1st.","Kind of mediocre. You get research instantly and can\'t develop a new phone while waiting for sales to finish. The in-game rating system could be fixed. A few of the customization functions are locked behind separate payments, in other words you\'d have to purchase each of said options once. While I hate to be that guy, but the amount of ads are a little agitating. The UI could use with some performance improvements. Not a bad concept at all. But the game just doesn\'t work particularly well.","I love this game, but have one issue with it. All of the options are realistic and offer an experience I haven\'t seen much of from smartphone tycoons. My main issue is that you can\'t do more than 1 task at a time, or at least not that I have seen. While the employees are creating/researching one phone, I should be able to start on a new one to have available in queue."],"appId":"com.roasterygames.smartphonetycoon2","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.roasterygames.smartphonetycoon2&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.armorgames.sodadungeon2":{"title":"Soda Dungeon 2","description":"Your favorite fizzy dungeon crawler is back!

There\'s new characters, a new land to battle in, even new monsters. (by the way) the \\"Bone Witch\\" looks amazing like something out of a comic book.\ud83d\udc4d It\'s of course a bit more challenging now and takes a bit more time, still a lot of fun! One of if not the best Dungeon Crawler you\'ll find. I can\'t wait to get my hands on that wizard character. \ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udcaf","Great so far. I love the old school feel. Lots of incentive to play. Flaws, when leaving a dungeon, it says progress will be saved. After MOST ads, it\'s a blank screen and restart is required. My progress is NOT saved. This includes voluntary ads. A lot of time is wasted messing with this. I\'m a little too bitter to pay for no ads. I haven\'t had enough fun because of this","Fun just like the first one! The main problem is that the runs take a long time, even when skipping ahead levels. I wish there was a fast forward button. You may have to buy that for a lot of (in-game) money or buy a bundle for it, but you have to go through at least 4 prestiges, which equates to like 1000 levels. Happy it works offline!","This is one of the best idle games I\'ve played, and it\'s only optionally idle, the normal gameplay is good as well. My only problem is popup ads every once and a while after dungeon runs, but I can look past those to give this game 5 stars. The implementation of ads in every other way is fair and optional, and you can eventually buy the ability to get rid of ads with gold in the game.","I enjoyed it for a while, until things really slowed down and got very tedious. The inevitably long waits to get through the dungeon are really annoying, and boosting the speed doesn\'t do much to help. Also paid to remove ads from the game, but all that did was remove the tiny banner ad I had no problem with during battle. I was still bombarded with loads of ads for everything else though."],"appId":"com.armorgames.sodadungeon2","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.armorgames.sodadungeon2&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.outfit7.movingeye.swampattack":{"title":"Swamp Attack","description":"Your swamp is under attack!

I just wish that one of the weapons from the Challenge levels (the level where you are given a Revolver) became a main weapon you can use after clearing the respective challenge level (I think it was challenge 8). That way, you have a choice between the strong, but slow reloading, shotgun, or the quick reloading Revolver with less ammo. You can make the upgrades damage and reload speed, rather than larger clip.","It\'s honestly a fun game, but becomes incredibly difficult after only a little bit. The shotgun is too slow and doesn\'t seem to be faster or stronger after upgrading. The energy system is horrible. You get like 5 or 6 plays then you wait for a long time. The coin system sucks as well. You get less than a thousand coins for each match and it requires well over a couple thousand to upgrade or buy. The game is fun, but it\'s too difficult and has a horrible system.","Absolutely love this game and this is the second most interesting game that I have ever played so far after crazy penguin war\'s. I completed all the levels and was waiting for more updates but I don\'t know what happened as the game would freeze form time to time and I won\'t be able to play at all. So I reinstalled it for about four times but still then the game would freeze and the screen would turn Black.","Fun. But the lack of any kind of regular updates means you cant advance once you have beat all levels. And, when you upgrade, it is hard to tell any difference in the strength of weapons. The shotgun takes forever to load, even when it is fully upgraded. They have promised new levels for almost a year now. If you invest anything financially, the lack of updates and consideration of you, as a customer, is extremely disappointing.","Its a very entertaining game to play. But, my one gripe with the game is that when ever the double points option pops up, I go to select it and it just disappears as soon as I touch the screen and I lose out on doubling my points. Very annoying. Another thing, it takes way too long to upgrade your equipment. You never have enough coins to do so."],"appId":"com.outfit7.movingeye.swampattack","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.outfit7.movingeye.swampattack&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.SimpleMission.SwordofOath":{"title":"Sword of Oath - Roguelike Card","description":"Roguelike, card and RPG are fused to make this best single player deckbuilding game\\nCCG battles & adventure ahead\\n\\nFeatures:\\n- Summon and Upgrade Heroes and their Cards: \\n- Enemies differ each dungeon\\n- Dynamic Deck Building: Choose and use your card wisely\\n- Powerful Abilities Building: Artefacts and blessings can be purchased during the battle","descriptionHTML":"Roguelike, card and RPG are fused to make this best single player deckbuilding game<br>CCG battles &amp; adventure ahead<br><br>Features:<br>- Summon and Upgrade Heroes and their Cards: <br>- Enemies differ each dungeon<br>- Dynamic Deck Building: Choose and use your card wisely<br>- Powerful Abilities Building: Artefacts and blessings can be purchased during the battle","summary":"Build your deck, slay monsters, Invent your strategies, explore dark dungeons","installs":"500+","minInstalls":500,"maxInstalls":947,"score":0,"scoreText":"0.0","ratings":0,"reviews":0,"histogram":{"1":0,"2":0,"3":0,"4":0,"5":0},"price":0,"free":true,"currency":"USD","priceText":"Free","available":true,"offersIAP":true,"IAPRange":"$0.99 - $99.99 per item","androidVersion":"4.4","androidVersionText":"4.4","developer":"Dark Void","developerId":"Dark+Void","developerEmail":"darelldeckcard@gmail.com","developerWebsite":"https://discord.com/invite/s4dkmz37","developerAddress":"No 2, Unit 5, 13 Xuzhou Fifth Village","privacyPolicy":"https://sites.google.com/view/simple-mission/%E9%A6%96%E9%A1%B5","developerInternalID":"Dark+Void","genre":"Card","genreId":"GAME_CARD","icon":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/xtXn3Yu_OH-2A2frytKpp-L2p6S0M8lS2UNE0yCqbbR7NHNs0nqlCRrPt_slo0qHctqq","headerImage":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/94XzWyGdxM_pt2uQKKoosGFjXf3QXQMdKuD6BugBwqcBeUuFKUyhiG2ScDjw8KAyVac","screenshots":["https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/byJi3uXNNZTeUYbhLB8rhXLkf_BD5CVViw9l8ZWe-206leMmzpDjAoy2Ukel9uLQdHA","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/HO63CN52tqHcWpPDj3HUnfDoaz7z_8brtRHeP07Jc1odZ2eTcQDr6u_UUK0keNuDVQ","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/4lPRxlvtymvPmu4Ybpu4BPOBr8jnZcjKSrEqlNU0IXp7TrnFxUaKykOwKnH82dQDN8mO","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/gUJBfA5IDggV-9TVldP5AwGhEP9Ao4a77BEhBh2F5hAp7wy7q3e-RxRUbtUYcUcC0g","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/jo83AOmFluWfe9LvjJ0HLpyemI2SIioPr7myPUTTYi9jKJr0w2aUD2QQWpdsHUr2POXz","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/gcQQ5ZrFuz7IOrxR1fb3LgclpDWeypLU8vb-suJWIqqWLEk_7Gc4MXL0A4VfTNJqS8w","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/ujyXrfZHN25WCjsT57YFYpGOEpn9SnLHAaNMfEkU2JWgvo3E3MC3bqgaS8r5eI5LOmmM","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/EeJrJqINKwPhT0i1yT_4QzqRvIAplnohVfcGqm3MSvhddyx03IBQyZ2eLjDnY5Eubg","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/h2Nb7oYrtR7QmMNzb4qXEF-HPyxVOvqxzY6SxepytEf17hlF-AX01L165kKpCa77T3tI","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/1mSYxvf7XNgLD3D18X0sWf7eUtPJj5elxM_ulEV7CywH5ceRr9Sph8wB0eL0Rm2E1Lk","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/AiYFsOZGLip5-O3o53xvnOEZ1-A5vFnVsaQW5o12tVr_DsHvByiXAhFY8jTwjq_zfd8","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/fkJut-GJ0e_OWIuDJdAe8t6X5An6xastMy2Plsm1O-1M7wXdP-NvfgSztbmvC1R8oIk","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/NT7-dtSHCPWS-oyQyInPDonq36d0SdRmd7Fla6zrqQFQxxUcg3keU5DQbldNrwXK5jY","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/GxabXrcGDw4TfqYSMENuqGyIlpZ-2KRQrhEZwgvzohUebqWSqU8L74cPbFGwYDxONDM","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/9lWOrFXL6cxsLR7Dmj0ZPTxcjTN3UYyaHTZibtG4ZUl6QWhy-KqBnnxgbtxH1uljvt8","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/KyuUQPshW5JfG7JPxw1UtTBMSwMcrbYYlBDSr_dMdQZ0MoSpNpJTv96t4821xIsWRw","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/mxGgPVtSGB71pOcz3YogCdteNP2iM5QsUwNvo2HTvIKSd2WId1tThgU9J2ak73D_Hfmc","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/8rHs-MY5nzWmqMU5cfn2_Z70y1GBh2tBXvjsZLYUxgHph66NxxTfaNBozuAN62hMRek","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/r0Omu6-7XJj2VdofGv87SV9hp3LgnDA2LUEhrh_vYSqYrB4blXaAJ4c9LdM0OA65Og"],"contentRating":"Everyone","adSupported":true,"released":"Nov 4, 2021","updated":1649933692000,"version":"5.0","recentChanges":"Roguelike, card and RPG are fused to make this best deckbuilding game<br>CCG battles &amp; adventure ahead<br><br>Features:<br>- Summon and Upgrade Heroes and their Cards: <br>- Enemies differ each dungeon<br>- Dynamic Deck Building: Choose and use your card wisely<br>- Powerful Abilities Building: Artifacts and blessings can be purchased during the battle<br>-Parkour mode is full of challenges.<br>-Combo, strategy and luck, they are all you need to conquer the world!<br>-Story mode is added<br>-Hero Gallery is enabled","comments":["Is nice.because is offline with 3 campaign type ( mission Easy /Adventure hard/ endless void) ,the game is similar as..

Tap Busters has some of the coolest most unique graphics I\'ve ever seen, which adds to the addiction of getting new armor. I have only one complaint and that is evolutions. The game takes incredibly long to get back to your next evolution stage when you get up to the thousands. Other than that this game is a must have for any idle lovers.","It\'s a lot of fun, but at the end of the day, it\'s just another tap game. There\'s too much saturation of these types of games and it just gets old. You tap. Your character shoots. The enemy gets shot. You can upgrade over time with the money earned from tapping. You think this time it will be a different kind of tap hero, but you\'re going to be heavily disappointed. It\'s the same as all the others. Lack of creativity in storytelling. Great artwork though.","A really nice idle game, thought you still need to be quite active to get somewhere. Cool weapons and armor, a lot of customization options! A big plus is the \\"talent\\" feature on both skills and evolution points. The only thing that bugs me is the wait time between levels, please remove it for faster progression. Good work","Transitions between monsters and between levels are very slow. It made me feel like I don\'t even want to evolve/prestige \'cause of the time it took to get back to the level where I was before. Remove the extra waiting times so we can rush through the lower levels after we prestige.","Super slow game, very low and slow progress... I waste one week on it, I didn\'t even reach the 7th upgrade for my weapon, and every thing is expensive... and the gold drop per kill is so damn little. the game has good graphics indeed and a lot of good features, but it is slow and the boredom hits the player after finishing couple levels without making much money."],"appId":"com.metagamestudio.tapbusters","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.metagamestudio.tapbusters&hl=en&gl=us"},"sk.phx.terrarium":{"title":"Terrarium: Garden Idle","description":"Try the most relaxing crop idle game: discover, collect and grow lovely plants to increase your oxygen income and expand your garden!\\n\\nLet\u2019s relax in this chill and cute mobile/idle game.

I would consider paying to support the game and remove ads if it was less. Theres an ad every time a level up, every time I switch worlds, ect\'. Other than that this game is amazing and so fun to play!","I have played 3 weeks and unlocked all 3 terrariums. After a day of ads, I liked it enough to purchase the monthly sub but was disappointed with how little game there is. There needs to be more levels with weekly or biweekly events. More decorations you can earn, even without buffs, would be nice. I loved the game, the graphics and the gameplay but for where it is now, NOT worth $4.99/month or to put up with the ads, of which there were far too many.","The number and length of the ads on the non paid version are excruciating. Every 30 seconds or so, a red cardinal flies across the screen with a special envelope whose only purpose is to invite you to watch another ridiculously long ad to get more points. You can\'t access any of the cute ornaments and books for your terrarium without getting the paid version. Every time you level up you have to watch more ads that take ten tries to x out of.","I can\'t take care of actual plants for the life of me, so this app fulfills the plant wanting, without the actual plants. Although the concept is simple and even boring to some, I love this game. Has got to be my FAVORITE app on my phone and tablet. Everyone needs this app, it\'s really great to use in between studying or homework. I use it when I\'m stressed or overstimulated. It\'s fun to see yourself gain more plants and progress.","Every time you level up you are given 2 options regarding the bonus points you get. >Collect Or >Collect x3 (by watching a short ad) So my question is: WHY DO YOU SHOW AN AD NO MATTER WHICH ONE IS CHOSEN? WHAT IS THE POINT OF GIVING US AN OPTION IF YOURE JUST GONNA BOMBARD US WITH ADS ANYWAYS? It\'s obnoxious. EDIT: upon looking at other reviews this problem has been in place since 2018. Four years. I\'m prob uninstalling today, this is NOT RELAXING. Originally: 3 stars, but now? 1.

Optimize skill preset page.<br>3.Fixed the bug related to achievement rewards claiming.<br>4. Other bug fixes.","comments":["A cute idea but the game is clunky and needs some kinks worked out. I shouldn\'t be allowed to click out of the fairy chest if I don\'t want to watch an ad. I\'ve had to click multiple times because my clicks aren\'t registering. I was tricked into watching an ad because I was receiving rewards for achievements and the ad button suddenly popped up where the recieve button was. Ultimately not a good gameplay experience.","Pushing Ads On you. When the chest fly\'s across the screen and I touch it...it brings up money you can get if you view an ad but there\'s no way to click out of it at all. That\'s not right, I don\'t want to be forced to watch that ad. The only way to get it off your screen is to click it or close down your game by hitting your home button on the phone.","Unprompted ads. It\'s such a shame, the game seemed really fun. But the constant ads when upgrading gear really makes this game unplayable. If the unprompted ads would be removed, this would be a top notch game.","Its a simple yet nice idle games. Little bit a fun stories and done, back to afk. The progression is a bit slow (its a bit faster while idle since you can catch fairy box for ads rewards), end-game equips are really expensive while gold gains are small (you can buy gold with dimension frag, tho). The moment you stuck progressing, then its lvling > rebirth fiesta. Overall, the games are good for who love idle / login > check stuff > logout style. The ads are not bothering much, at least for me.","Game wasn\'t bad for a free idle game. So I bought the 14.99 2 free 5 click upgrade. It didn\'t work but my money was still take. So I logged in in the game did a cloud upload. Uninstaller and re installed the game only to find I can\'t download my cloud save and I have to pay the 14.99 again to get my upgrade."],"appId":"com.loongcheer.moke.pixelknight.idlerpg.adventure","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.loongcheer.moke.pixelknight.idlerpg.adventure&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.hg.townsmen7free":{"title":"Townsmen","description":"From humble backwater to medieval metropolis - build the city of YOUR dreams!\\n\\nDevelop your tiny village to a grand medieval empire with a thriving economy and happy villagers!

My one complaint would be the buildings don\'t change after being improved a level. It is enjoyable to watch the townsmen go about their daily lives and how theatrical some dialog can get in a few quests. This game isn\'t a blatant cash grab; which ironically makes it worth a lot of money.","The gameplay is solid, reminds you of age of discovery, the graphics are quaint in a good way, similar to a polished Stronghold, and unlike a few other mobile games, many of the cosmetics can be purchased for gold, not crowns (premium currency), which is good as they are required to keep citizens happy. However, perhaps this is my device, but I crash every 20-30 minutes, which in of itself isn\'t a big deal, except that it is paired with a low frequency of auto saves, losing upwards of 10 minutes","I\'d give it 5 stars, except for the fact it crashes a lot during the forced advert. Something is causing it to shut down when it\'ll attempt to start the count down time for an advert. Fix that issue for 5 stars. Thanks. Outside of that issue, I really enjoy the game. The adverts are bothersome, but ok. The banner at the top is the same. Fix the buggy issue and I have no problems.","this is one of the best simulation games ive played on mobile, if not the best. I love the weather effects, and that you can zoom in and hear townspeople and noises! my only complaint is that the people cry out for (herbs, hops, etc) and its right next to them. Other than that, this game is AWESOME! if the music could change with the season\'s, that would be wonderful, but nonetheless, the different scenarios are really fun too, thank you!","5 stars for the game. 0 star for the ridiculous amount of pop up ads. find a better way to deliver ads because every time i get on a roll, i get interrupted by another ad. I\'m not paying to get rid of ads if i feel forced to; lessen the volume of them and then i might, or just charge for the game itself. That\'s better than making it unplayable until we pay for the ad-free version."],"appId":"com.hg.townsmen7free","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hg.townsmen7free&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.DL.war.planes.inc.torpedo.bomber.fighter.aircraft.ww2":{"title":"Warplanes Inc.

But I do have some issues 1. There is a audio bug where the audio completed cuts out after an add plays 2. The flight controls are a little wonky but definitely are not so bad that it\'s unbearable 3. The in app purchase are steep but with that being said I think this game has 1 developer and you can tell they have a vision and do care about the game. Even though I have issues with the game I do completed recommend the game!","Dude I\'m dying of laughter, I keep changing reviews from good to bad, and bad to good, there\'s a funny bug I encountered on the 3rd plane I think, where I crashed into a plane, landed on the runway, and won the level, even though my plane got destroyed. I also agree with Shane Rogers, it is pretty strange how certain things aren\'t the selected language.","So far i like the game. But i think that it needs some work in the air defense mode. Anti-air guns takes a bit long to reload, it may be that im just not good but i cant get past 2:43mins in that game mode. I cant keep up against 10+ plus planes flying in my air space. Besides that, i think its an ok game. I like the graphics, simple and good.","One of the best games I\'ve played in a while! Very in depth and well put together! The flight mechanics are Farley realistic as well! Great job devs!!! After completing the campaign I am just completely amazed the amount of work put into the development of this game! The story is incredible and I am definitely stoked to play the other modes that were unlocked after I completed the Campaign! P.S. First game of its kind I\'ve come across that has replay value! Keep up the great work guys!","It\'s a cool game, with some nice physics and momentum going for it. It\'s a bit bothersome at times, since you don\'t fly very fast, so everytime you crash you gotta get back into the air again, and then try to blow up your adversaries with some fairly difficult (though fair) controls. It\'s not bad. If you want to play a decant game that doesn\'t constantly annoy you, then get this one."],"appId":"com.DL.war.planes.inc.torpedo.bomber.fighter.aircraft.ww2","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.DL.war.planes.inc.torpedo.bomber.fighter.aircraft.ww2&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.stereo7games.wwd":{"title":"World War Defense","description":"A free tower defense strategy game!

Too many errors and spelling mistakes. Edit:A new issue. Units get upgrades at certain thresholds, the first upgrade had a 15 min timer, it goes to 4 hours for the second upgrade, that\'s 32 hours for just active units.","Just hit level 100 with my characters. In order to break 99 to 100 you must pay 5 million coins, plus wait 8 hours for training for each character. or watch 8 ads at 30 seconds a piece. Terrible idea when I have a full roster of characters... Edit, also the reward for finishing a level is terrible, 180 thousand coins rewsrded for completing level 650, costs 2 million to level up a single character or module at the moment.","It starts off well, but after a few levels the ads cause the game to crash and I end up having to reset. It got annoying and I uninstalled after a day. This issue needs to be fixed for future players.","Honestly it\'s quite a good game. I just have a bit of criticism and that is the speed. It can go up to x2 speed but sometimes for grinding it\'s better if it could go faster. So a idea is give a mini menu that pops up when you click the speed and it has 1x 1.5x 2x 3x 4x 5x. But other than that I really like the game, it\'s fun to play when you have nothing to do all day. Edit* One more is while upgrading it can be annoying after afking to have to spam upgrade. So you hold for 3 seconds and it go","I recently accidently tapped the top left corner of my screen, giving me access to the dev console, in which I gave my self millions of gems coins xp and level, I\'m at the point where when I go to upgrade say my transport, the game gives me coins instead of the opposite.

Get in the game for some zombie killing mayhem now!","comments":["Well fun game for the most part. I\'m editing my review after playing daily since October of 2021. My views have changed a lot. First I don\'t mind the ad system. It\'s rewarding and mostly voluntary. The draw system is decent, but does have its flaws. Especially the golden keys and tracked Sims. Gathering 10 can be difficult and the return on that effort can be less than rewarding. This is a game for whales. It can cost alot if you wanna move up quickly.","This is a fun game, it truly is. My only issue with the way it operates is the progression speed of the game, it\'s truly just slow, dull, and boring in the sense that I could travel the actual United States faster than the completion rate of some of these levels. I recommend either decreasing the amount of levels you have to complete or decrease the 30 seconds per stage to 5-10 seconds because, even in the early game it takes forever just to around .75-1 level a day.","An excellent take on an idle game. You can choose to go offline, but it\'s far more rewarding if you stay by your team. It\'s also very well paced, as you can his pass a level by the skin of your teeth, and get a reward right after that would have helped you blow through that same level. Overall very fun, especially the stat increases. Speaking of stats, Albuquerque is insanely broken. Literally 5 of his skills are damage increases, and there\'s another 3 that a few of those piggyback on.","The game is entertaining, a fun way to spend a few minutes or an hour. Plenty of characters and weapons. My concern is similar to other reviewers that towns aren\'t consistent in that some are fairly easy to pass in a few days with occasional upgrading of the people while others require your complete and undistracted assistance with tapping to get anywhere past halfway. Also, the gold drop is inconsistent making it difficult if not impossible to upgrade your people in certain towns.","The game was great up until the recent update. They changed it so you almost never get any new characters sim cards, and removed all ways of getting silver tickets by replacing daily rewards with a lot less helpful items. Overall, it was a fun game and worth the time, but not any more. Don\'t waste your time until this is fixed, otherwise you will never get far."],"appId":"com.sonypicturestelevision.zombieland","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sonypicturestelevision.zombieland&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.ftt.eroica.gl.aos":{"title":"Eroica","description":"More than just an adventure in search of fate and truth!

Great 3D animation and designs all around. Really fits the atmosphere they are trying to show from the games identity. The requirements are a bit high though. This in turn bring a few glitches to the game. Such as a double screen after loading from the cafe. As well as, freezing on some story progression. Please fix this if possible.","This is a 5 star game. BUT my issue is that you guys make some things unnecessarily difficult even with tutorials available to assist the player. While I did figure it out on my own, you need to make going to places such as 1-10 to 1-11 more obvious. That yellow \\"Q\\" doesn\'t really stick out well. While the game itself should be challenging, it should not be challenging to figure out how to progress yourself in the game. Please make it easier to figure out where you need to go on the map.","After playing for a few days I\'ve a better feel for this game. It\'s pretty fun but I docked another start for two reasons. First is that when your adventure you have to pay attention and click on background elements to get rewards. Second is the stupid recruitment system that requires 100% attendance for a month to get the chosen hero. I despise that mechanic and it\'s likely why I\'ll end up dropping this.","I could get past the lag and the discord link being cut off by the screen so I can\'t receive the reward. What I can\'t get past is the greed. There aren\'t microtransactions in this game, instead they want to charge you 25 USD for a 10 summon. I can buy 2 or 3 games on Steam for that price. All of the shop prices are insanely expensive. What a way to ruin a game that could\'ve been great.","I\'m really enjoying the game and characters, but this game seems to be overheating my phone.

No forced ads which is incredible, and the waves feel fun, and yet each new wave is a different challenge. I would give it 5 stars except for two things: 1. There are 3 attacks that are almost the exact same, and 2. The run is often determined by luck. It would be super awesome if there was a way to get more than 3 choices, and also while cool, the skill tree gets repetitive. These are all very minor things and overall the game is a great experience.","I would love to give this game five stars because the gameplay is very simple yet fun, the enemies and items all seem balances and fair, and there are barely any ads. However unfortunately it suffers from one major weakness. It crashes. A lot. Just recently as I started playing the trial levels for chapter two I haven\'t been able to get past the second stage because the level always crashes before I can complete it. It\'s a new game, so hopefully these issues will be fixed in an update.","Overall good fun, with a good mix of tactics, reaction and luck. Does get a bit repetitive, however, especially as a single level often takes 15 minutes to complete. And if you get unlucky and get a few bad rolls on your weapons/supplies, you may have to start over. Also, the screen starts to fill up too much in the \'late game\' when you have everything maxed out and are shooting 6 different weapons constantly. It makes it almost impossible to see enemies.","Challenging, but amazing fun. I honestly expected this to be another ad powered casual game that I would play for a few days and then quit when the ads got to my nerves. Instead, it\'s a semi intense game of luck and strategy, action and discovery that really keeps me invested. The ads are there, but you chose when to watch and they\'re worth it. Overall, it\'s fun for anyone looking for an engaging experience.","Good but with noticeable bugs. This game is fun, however, the most noticeable bug that I have run into is that enemies have completely random percentage changes in their damage as the time progresses. Had to edit this review as this had only occured two of the first three times I played this. It hasn\'t happened since and so I imagine it could have been an odd, phone issue. Since it hasn\'t occurred again, I will adjust my rating to 5 stars - as this is a good game!"],"appId":"com.dxx.firenow","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dxx.firenow&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.ninjakiwi.sasza4":{"title":"SAS: Zombie Assault 4","description":"Purge the undead!

","comments":["A very enjoyable game; that being said, there are a few issues/suggestions I have. The first one is that I feel high-level strongboxes are too hard to get (I do like the strongbox mechanic, just maybe a rarity rebalancing or something). Also, multiplayer games feel slightly unstable at times, and I do wish there was singleplayer nightmare mode. I would recommend it, it is a lot of fun especially to play in short bursts, and it\'s nice there\'s a singleplayer option as well.","If you factor in the cheapest in-game purchase of $2.50 to remove ads, this is a really nice game for the price. It\'s on multiple platforms, all cross compatible and still being updated after I think a decade. It has tons of play time and I appreciate the story and map design. It\'s definitely been refined, and has few bugs compared to a lot of mobile games. A nice take on a serious top down apocalyptic RPG. I would recommend it.","First off, they finally updated the game. I thought it was abandoned since 2015, but they updated it! They actually listened! I don\'t want to be greedy, but there are some things they could fix since they are back. Players are constantly disconnecting. If everyone disconnects during a last man standing, it fails it and you get no place on the event board. Me and this guy were the last 2, and he left before I won. Instead of giving me the win, it gave me no board placement. Last man is unplayable","I think this game is amazing but to top it off you need to make it where you can add Friends and play with them for all events and multiplayer aspects and more ways to talk to your team. It would be incredible but other than that keep the game alive with new content. It\'s could climb to the top of the charts incredibly fast. Keep continue to keep the game alive","I used to play this years ago. Redownloaded it and was so happy to see that all of my data was still backed up AND the game is still live. 3 different classes with unique abilities and perks, countless weapons, armor pieces and augments for both weapons and armor make the possibilities endless. Deploy turrets to assist you against the zombie hordes, play solo, with friends or randoms in classic SAS 3 style missions or special events that change every day. This game has always been a blast. 5\u2606"],"appId":"com.ninjakiwi.sasza4","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ninjakiwi.sasza4&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.square_enix.android_googleplay.WOTVffbeww":{"title":"FINAL FANTASY BE:WOTV","description":"In the latest work of the FINAL FANTASY BRAVE EXVIUS series, experience a battle that has remained unknown in the world of FFBE...until now.\\n\\nCharacters from past FINAL FANTASY titles will be included!\\n\\nTwin princes and the beautiful steel maiden\u2014\\nThe War of the Visions begins! \\n\\n\u2022 ---------------------------------------- \u2022\\n\u3000\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Gameplay\\n\u2022 ---------------------------------------- \u2022\\nExperience the stories of each kingdom and its warriors on the continent of Ardra by exploring Story Quests, World Quests, Event Quests, and more.\\nCooperate with other players to progress in Multiplayer Quests, or compete online via Duel.\\n\\n\uff1cBattle System\uff1e\\nThe pinnacle of tactical battles, presented in 3D terrains with various elevations.

The auto-play AI is pretty good. However the in-battle UI needs work, simply telling a unit to move to a square is a pain. There\'s no transparency for terrain so you need to rotate the camera whenever there\'s a hill/tree, no recognition for squares you can\'t move to (e.g. occupied by another unit), and switching to top-down view spins the map to a pre-set orientation, with no icons distinguish units other than the tops of their 3d models.","My favorite gacha style games are more than just card games and random draws for jpegs and gifs. The ones that hook me the most are ones with interesting gameplay that reproduce the feeling of its source material. I say all that to qualify that this game has done an amazing job adapting final fantasy tactics to mobile. I have FFT but can\'t stand the controls. FFBEWOTV has a great story, and feels like FFT without the clunky ported PS1 controls. Also, they added Tifa.","I really like the game but they need to make the characters from different final fantasies Cross overs more Available within a reasonable amount of time . If you get a character from a different final fantasy, It take forever for the character To become available again. If they finally come back around an you did not get to level the character up They are stuck at that same level because you can\'t get the character shards anymore or the materials needed for Items to advance in thier levels.","The Story is great, better than what was expected from a mobile game. There is a ton of content that can keep you busy for a while. The real down sides come down to the interface, because there is so much to do expecally if you are new it feels like you have no idea where to start. There is so much to collect, Units, Weapons, Visions, Crafting items, it gets bit much. The worst part is the Gatcha system though, I spent $100 to attempt to get Bahamut and nothing.","Happy to get Lara, but not happy that the game crashed during my unit summons. Also the game crashes randomly for weeks with no fixes. I can\'t stay on game long enough to play it. Can\'t do my guild leader duties, can\'t do event quests,and game crashes as i leveling or change units equipment, etc. It makes the over all experience not fun. My mobile phone is more than capable to run the game app, the latest Android, 5gb ram, and plenty of storage space.

I\'ve had crashes before but now it\'s just ridiculous especially with the last 2 updates. I can\'t even load it up. It just turns off in the black loading page. It might start up once every 10 tries, which sometimes that doesn\'t work. Once I get it started by luck, it crashes and shuts down again soon after when I go to change the page or something. Absolutely impossible to play anymore.","Unable to even open the game as it crashes immediately had this problem for about a week now and from what I\'ve seen this has been a problem for a long time. I\'ve spent hundreds of dollars in this game and am well built in it, I can\'t grind or even use my stamina this needs to be fixed immediately :Edit- I dropped this game as it was never fixed constantly crashes making it unplayable and here I am again and the game is STILL unplayable! This is just ridiculous! It\'s like the devs don\'t care!","Decent game, play on steam though. Andorid version keeps crashing as of the latest update there needs to be a patch that fixes this as I can\'t even get past the title screen. This is a problem for many players on mobile. The steam version is more stable so use that one instead if you want to play. Buying gems are expsenive. F2p is possible this game if you grind for it. Gameplay is fun, spritework and art is great and the animations are quality. Bugs need to be fixed though as rn its unplayable","Edit: I really like this game, I wish there was a proper Disgaea game with a comparable roster, but every update is a nightmare trying to find enough space. Some of the new features are neat, but I feel like the point of a mobile game is missed and too much data is dedicated to one of several pass schemes trying to get blood from a stone. Even though I like it better than one game I have on my phone, I had to drop this one because that\'s just kicking the can down the road with the space problem.","I want to point out that this is NOT a tactics RPG like the mainline Disgaea games, it\'s an auto battler. However, everything else is on point! I waited on this one for a while, because - and I don\'t mean this in a hurtful way - a LOT of Boltrend\'s games, particularly their licensed titles, have quality problems. Translation errors still pop up in places but the main story so far has been consistent, and it\'s been very easy to get up to speed with all the first time player extras I\'ve gotten."],"appId":"com.boltrend.disgaea.en","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.boltrend.disgaea.en&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.notdoppler.earntodie2":{"title":"Earn to Die 2","description":"Drive your car through a zombie apocalypse in this massive follow-up to the chart-topping hit Earn to Die!\\n\\nAn evacuation ship is waiting on the other side of the country.

An ad would pop up after 3-4 runs, no biggie. But now it\'s after every run, and these ads have 3 screens to close most of the time. It\'s nuts, and the game is SO good. I played through it years ago before this insane ad culture whatever appeared. Such a bummer...","This game is awesome. I just beat it at just under 500 days. I like that the game is beatable without having to pay for things. I watched a ton of ads though for extra money. The amount of forced ads to playing is amazingly balanced. The only thing I do not like is that every cars strength and power is the same. I think that when the cars get bigger and more powerful the obstacles should become bigger and stronger. My tiny starter car should not blast through the same as the giant dump truck.","loads of fun! Game isnt so easy or dull that I delefed it after one day, but also not too difficult that it gets frustrating. The action and graphics are fun and exciting. Like all free games, there are commercials after each course, but the courses are long enough that you dont feel like you spend more time on ads than you do on the actual game. two thumbs up!","This has to be the most replayable game i\'ve installed (& reinstalled). i played 1 & 2 in highschool 8 years ago and still occasionally play. The controls are accurate. Each time you go back in you can go through a different route, and can always improve your distance, with good strategy. This game always keeps me entertained and i would rate 6 stars if possible. And if i could beg the devs to make a third, i\'d do it 100 times. Highly recommend!","Games sorta fun. It gets a bit boring. After every 3 stopping points, you get a new car. Can\'t use the previous one so you\'re stuck with a slow, unupgraded car yet again. It\'s pretty much rinse and repeat. If you don\'t feel like playing, you get much more money watching adds than you would actually playing so if you want to get through the boring parts, do that."],"appId":"com.notdoppler.earntodie2","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.notdoppler.earntodie2&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.babeltimeus.legendstd":{"title":"Realm Defense: Hero Legends TD","description":"Defenders!

Levels become harder as progress. But still fun since this allows play offline, great option when there\'s no wifi available. And they have more worlds and levels too now. Too many complain need buy gems but so far have been doing just fine playing it free. They give you enough gems to save up for heroes (just depends which you choose). This app is frustrating that it occasionally crashes before it launches. So just beware and save progress.","I\'ve been playing at a steady pace for months. Very fun and enjoyable, lots of things to expand to keep the game fun. A tad slower than I\'d perfer, and sometimes you need certain characters to get through levels, or it will be very difficult. That\'s the worst feature, as these characters cost a lot of in game currency that I\'d rather spend elsewhere. All in all though, about as solid a tower defense game you could ask for, I\'d try it out if I were you! :)","This game is a lot of fun. Engaging mechanics and fun heroes. However, the cost of advancement is very steep. The cash prices for heroes and resources are very high, and the rate of gain for crystals is WAY too slow. The recently added achievements are broken for experienced players. Many of them cannot be completed without starting a new account. Please fix this issue!","As the game continued to add features (which is great), it consistently locked many of said features behind pay walls (which is awful). Moreover, it began to make even basic functions (such as progression, leveling, etc.) pay-walled, unless you don\'t playing for 5 minutes daily for months just to accumulate what you would need. Sad, as I played this game when it was first released and it had so much potential, to the point where I wouldn\'t mind investing. Now, it\'s simply too expensive.","Fun tower-defense game. Not pay-to-win. Customer service is slow but good. The game definitely gets more challenging as I go along, which is great. It seems a bit overly complicated. For example, each of your heroes has a level and a rank and abilities and \\"awakenings\\" to level up.

I don\'t know. I guess it didn\'t look very appealing, at first... It\'s actually rather addictive. Requires good strategy to stop the onslaught of enemy barreling down on you, and the ability to change it on the fly. Play is technically turn based, but not slow paced, as you might think it would be. F2p is totally possible, but I personally won\'t have an issue spending a few dollars on a game that absolutely deserves it, like this one. Thanks, devs!","I\'ve played a few different games like this one. And it\'s basically a strategic matching tower defense. You can only merge the same units. And they must have the same level. And your only goal is to defeat the waves of enemies before they get to your commander. The ability to play offline is a nice addition, and it\'s a simple game with advanced quick thinking to outmaneuver the tetris like waves. I\'d recommend it to any tower defense, and/or tetris fans.","The gameplay is simple and intuitive, your strategies must evolve as you progress through the game. The upgrade system is well developed and metered. Resources are scarce enough you can\'t max everything too quickly but plentiful enough you dont have to grind. It\'s a fun, exciting, & challenging game! The graphics are great stylistically for the type of game it is. All in all it\'s a 10/10, keep up the great work guys, I look forward to your future releases and Ill download them all!","Solid foundation for great game. It\'s engaging both in its gameplay and art design, but also has depth of strategy and a potential for very strong late game. 5 stars to help support it and hope to see some improvements. Please improve UI. Add option to filter/sort/more easily compare blocks and teams. Please add option for more team slots, I\'d even be okay paying. More game modes, or progress tracks. Just need more ways to play and more data. Good game as is, room to be better.","Fun, cute game with simple mechanics. Very generous with rewards and has optional ads that don\'t get in your way, which is great, in my book. There\'s also NO ENERGY/STAMINA keeping you from playing the game (except for the Challenge mode, and Endless mode can be replayed by watching an ad). My one criticism is that I\'d like to see a game mode that does something different from the others. Something to break the formula. Otherwise this is a fun mobile game that I\'d recommend!"],"appId":"com.loadcomplete.mergedefense","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.loadcomplete.mergedefense&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.windforce.wjxt.fanti":{"title":"Infinite Cultivation","description":"Infinite Cultivation is based on genres of eastern fantasy literature (wuxia/xantian), an \'idle\', tick-based MUD(multi-user dungeon; the precursor to the MMORPG) that returns to the core of MMORPGs.\\n\\nThis is a huge world of immortal cultivation.

The more you level up, more options to play different things open up! Alot of free stuff given out too. You can make purchases for a reasonable price too! So much to do here that I keeps me busy daily. So if u feel like it doesn\'t have enough games to fight.....u haven\'t leveled up enough \ud83d\ude43 \ud83d\ude42","Very fun game, though it might have p2w features competing as a f2p player while might be hard and require quite a lot of determination it\'s still in an acceptable area. The overall aspect of the game is pretty simple and honestly I like it better than IT right now! Plus the game has ample options at the beginning to get you jump started if you\'re a bit late in joining a server. Overall I recommend if you\'re casual or not.","The game is a fun way to pass the time, the chat function in game is a little buggy, but from what I understand it\'s because of the auto translate feature. Some of the words get covered by other images would if fixed would be helpful. I would rate this higher, but the game crashed when I made a purchase and took the payment but didn\'t give me my items, I reached out to the in game support, it took a bit but the issue was taken care of.","The game is decent, in many ways it feels like a modded version of IT. It definitely feels more user friendly with a bunch of minor nitpicks from IT fixed or improved. There\'s still plenty of translation problems but it\'s playable and they seem open to suggestions. Major problem for me is that when I try buying bundles etc it brings up a screen for jade of the same price and charges me but I don\'t receive anything and character limits seem very small in text boxes making contacting support hard.","Overall it\'s a decent, relaxing tap gaming experience. If you want to level up quickly you do have to sink money into it, but it\'s optional and can go for the lengthier grind Issue I would have is the games aspect ratio, my text runs off the screen so I can\'t see requirements for the next sect level up 5-6"],"appId":"com.windforce.wjxt.fanti","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.windforce.wjxt.fanti&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.hidea.cat":{"title":"Cats & Soup - Cute idle Game","description":"\u2665Us cute catz hav arrived hooman!\u2665\\n<2021 Google Play Indie Games Festival TOP3 Selected Game>\\n\\nLooking for a cute cat game?\\nHere is a peaceful animal forest where cats boil their delicious soup!\\nAn idle relaxing cat game perfect for cat moms and dads  =\u272a \u11ba \u272a=\\n\\n1.

It does feel that way sometimes but if you could just beat the game instantly what would be the point. No forced ads is amazing. You can watch them to speed up progression. The only thing is I wish they would lower the cost of changing a Cats ability. I watch enough ads to bring in revenue and with such a high chance for lower star rating and so many options it is hard to get cats with the correct skill and high stars. 250-300 per resetplease","This game is adorable. It was fun in the first couple days of playing but after building about 8 things, I would watch an ad for coins every time the chance popped up. It\'s annoying. I also have to level up my things so I would have less money so I\'d have to watch more ads. Ehm it just got boring and repetitive with me going absolutely nowhere. I am uninstalling it but it was cute while it lasted.","I want to like this so much. But as many have said : TOO MANY ADS. I\'m sick of watching ads for games or apps I\'ll never in a million years download. Also, after you pass the C coin level, it\'s pretty much impossible to level up. Its basically an ad app at this point because I can\'t level. I want to enjoy this because it was so fun at first. Now I might just uninstall it since I won\'t be getting any new stations anytime soon.","This game is absolutely adorable and so fun to play! It is heavy on ads but they\'re strictly opt in which is nice. My only complaint is it would be nice to have two separate options for upgrading by one level and another option to upgrade by 10 levels. I\'m a bit weird about even numbers so it bothers me when I\'m forced to upgrade more than I wanted to."],"appId":"com.hidea.cat","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hidea.cat&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.spcomes.esabyss":{"title":"Abyss : Rebirth Phantom","description":"\u25c8 Enjoy the Idle game X RPG X Cute girls(Bishojyo) at once!\\nYou don\'t have to play for a long time.

The character art is very well made and the pixel art isn\'t bad either. However, whenever I watch an ad and return to the game, the game starts lagging like crazy. There isn\'t a graphics option so I\'m forced to close and reopen the game whenever I watch an ad for anything. Hopefully this can be fixed. Other than that, I\'m enjoying it","Fairly straight forward. Lots of ways to get free diamonds as long as you have patience and lot of clicking through characters. Game progression gets slow after first couple episodes. Offline does not seem to register correctly as stages does not progress the supposed amount. Needs balancing to make the game seem like there\'s more progression/interest.","Fun game. But for the love of my sanity change back to the previous ad networks you used. I\'m sick and tired of all these scam \'make money quick\' ads. It\'s to the point where I will quit the game every 20 seconds just so I don\'t watch it for any of the ad rewards. Hell, if there was a way to pay $5 to remove ads I\'d do that","Well, I\'ve been playing the game for 1 month now and just got my 30-day login reward. The game is fun for the first 2 weeks, then progression becomes slower and slower as you rebirth and upgrade your heroes. It\'s been an entire month and I\'m still on level 4000, the game goes up to 12000. I like the fact that it\'s not hard to get diamonds, but the odds of gettin 4 or 5 stars characters are pretty low, but that\'s not an issue. It\'s a good game but the progression system needs a rework.","This game is okay so far, but it has tons of freezing, delayed response and it does have a few typos. Thanks for the game, hope you can fix these issues! Thanks in advance~ Hi, it\'s me again, just wanted to let you know that this game is freezing really badly. Can if change the rating until this fixes the slow response from clicking and just tiresome."],"appId":"com.spcomes.esabyss","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.spcomes.esabyss&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.imcrazy.hs":{"title":"Hero Z","description":"Game background:\\nIn 2043 AD, the last human world war broke out, and the terrifying Z virus was dropped into the war.

The graphics, the gameplay, the sounds are good, except some sounds, for example, when you complete a mission, that sound isn\'t good for this game. The interface have so many things, it looks bad. The interface can be improved, for example when you go near of a character, the button to talk to him looks no good. The first cinematic when you start playing, at the end, the background looks bad. And I suggest one thing, dead sounds variations will be good.","Love this game ... It\'s hard to grind up the items needed to upgrade certin guns or animals and equally hard to gain the items that equip to ur person ...one thing I was wishing to b able to do was upgrade the abilities the person has ... Make them stronger by them selves .. other than that ... Great game... though also the vehicle is a bit hard to stear out of the way of lots of things ...","Fairly good rpg, I am removing a star however due to the forced screen orientation. It forced me to play the game in upside-down orientation on my tablet, which requires me to remove it from its dock. Other than this, what is to me an unnecessary feature, the game is decent and otherwise we\'ll crafted. Orientation probably is not as big a concern for phone players. Good game.","Overall ok game.

I admit, at first.. I thought it was totally lame.. But it only took me about 3 minutes to realize.. \'OK.. Maybe I was wrong.\' IT\'S FANTASTIC! Perfect for someone like me who has a hard time meditating my way out of being anxious.. It\'s the perfect distraction to focus my mind & relax so I can either get some sleep, or get on with my day. Since I started playing it.. My anxiety went from a 9 down to a more manageable 3 in less than 20 minutes.","An absolutely fantastic game. Beautiful graphics, even when simplistic. The puzzles start of easy and get more difficult as you progress. They never are impossible, you just need to think and try different permutations. The puzzles also change movements to keep your interest. And excellent game that is worth playing. You won\'t be sorry.","I can agree with these other reviews. Amazing game with beautiful pictures. I\'m not sure what the story is, but maybe it doesn\'t need one. It\'s beautiful as is. Music is fantastic, and as for the bugs and glitches, I have experienced the invisible puzzle piece glitch a couple of times. And sometimes the exit to level select button doesn\'t work. But other that, great game!","Very nice sliding puzzle game. Minimalist graphics -- which is not a bad thing at all here. The game music is gorgeous. The puzzles each have their own logic. In the earlier levels, the puzzles are very easy to solve. However, as you progress, they become increasingly difficult. The difficulty progression, by the way, is perfect. There are two issues, though, that I have with the game. First. it froze on me in a couple of levels, requiring that I restart those levels. Second, the story told by the game is much too obscure. I finished the game well enough -- but even then couldn\'t comprehend the story. On another note, some reviewers here said they finished the game in about an hour. That\'s nonsense. There are 70 levels. They would have had to have completed each level in less than a minute or so on average. Due to the imposing complexity of many of the more challenging puzzles in the later levels, that\'s simply impossible. So, either those reviewers have a completely wacked-out sense of time or they\'re greatly exaggerating their puzzle-solving abilities.","Top notch game. Music is nice and relaxing. The graphics are simple but look great. There are quite a bit of mechanics in game that may look hard but the stage progression makes sure that you understand how they work before mixing it up. Overall it\'s a great concept and it\'s a nice relaxing game to play. On a puzzle I didn\'t understand, I put my phone down for a minute, grabbed it again and apparently I was holding my phone upside down and that got me to solve the puzzle. If they released another game like this I would definitely play it. 10/10 No Regrets.

I\'ve been loving it ever since it came out! It\'s been LOADS of fun, I\'ve been looking for a fun pinball game, and World Flipper is just that! I love the music, and all the characters, as well as the art style. The gameplay is lovely. Keep up the great work! Only problems is it lags and now it lags even more. It worked better on Apple, but on Android... it just loads so slowly. There is also some...buffering in one of the last cutscenes from world 8.","Overall so far, it\'s really good! Cute art style, and it is just super great, other than a somewhat huge issue. They seem to be having account issues today (Sept 19 2021) and it logged me out! I don\'t know what it is doing to others\' accounts currently, but if each account that isn\'t linked to Google or Facebook is just being lost, that is pretty bad. Just a fair warning to new players. Note: This hasn\'t happened since, so I think it is safe to say that it isn\'t an issue.","Super fun game! But my complaint (like some others) is that the background is incredibly glitchy. I can\'t play for long because it truly messes with my eyes. Like similar complaints, I\'m using a Google Pixel 6. I would love to adjust my rating after this issue is solved and I can really get into playing.","Very enjoyable, fun mechanics, and despite it being a gacha game I found it very easy to roll and get good units. I offer two improvements that can be made to the game: 1: Deadeye is annoying to play. I like that you have to aim the shot but sometimes if you land in the middle of the flippers you literally can\'t aim and are forced to miss. It feels frustrating to get a 10+ combo and be forced to miss 2. Immune frames should exist! You should be immune to damage when you use your special","An innovative twist that combines pinball w/ active combat. Both the pixel art & character illustrations are very charming. There\'s also a large cast of characters, allowing for a lot of fun viable playstyles, even w/ lower star units. Although the story can sometimes be simplistic/clich\xe9d, it still has an element of mystery around it which is greatly enhanced by the dynamics b/w characters. The only main issue would probably be how the rewards for events can require a ton of tedious grinding."],"appId":"com.kakaogames.wdfp","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kakaogames.wdfp&hl=en&gl=us"},"cc.jasfun.wizard":{"title":"Super Wizard","description":"About Game\\nSuper Wizard is a Roguelike action game in which more than 20 magic skills can be chosen.

Game experience optimization","comments":["The dialogue moves too quickly in the intro, and anything you can read has been somewhat poorly translated. The game is certainly pretty, but almost laughably boring otherwise. There is a lot of missed potential here, and that is all but proven in another game which lacks the nice graphics of this one, and is by no means a beautiful game, but executes the idea *much* better. It is called Magic Survival. It\'s the exact same concept, but done well. I\'d say get that one instead..","I never complain about ads, ever! But you guys took an original, decent game in its own right, put some much needed polish on it, and then made immersion into the game all but IMPOSSIBLE. I would challenge the devs to play the game now as it stands. Go to level 8 and onwards and you have to watch a 30 second ad every 2 minutes just to stand a chance of beating these guys! I believe in financially supporting the devs of games I enjoy, but 30 dollars?? That\'s highway robbery. This is too bad.","Gameplay is alright. After leveling up you lose control when returning to the game which is annoying. Character moves super stupid slow, also annoying. Real reason for 1 star is how awful the ads are, the quality is garbage. To remove ads you have to pay 30 dollars. So my first two gripes are about very intentional choices to get you killed so you can watch a terrible ad so you\'re tempted to overpay for this utterly average game.","Pretty fun. The ad bonuses are too good to ignore, though, and there are a lot of ad bonuses. I think it would be more tolerable on a per-run or rechargeable set of activations basis, but like this I\'m just not inclined to keep beating my head against a wall (since there\'s a lot of grind) /and/ through hordes of ads. Rather do something else with my time.","This can easily gets 5 stars. I love everything about the game and it\'s really easy to lose track of time with this. Only problem I have is after an ad or choosing a skill you\'re left standing there and have to pick up/place your finger back down which has gotten me killed a couple times already. I would recommend a \\"press to continue\\" feature after those? Would eliminate the chance of getting wrecked because you had to choose a skill.

Unlocked Medusa, mostly epic gear, and can\'t do a damn thing in this game. Main quest? Chp 4 is unbeatable. Doom Tower? Stage 4 is unbeatable. All the \\"extra events\\". Can\'t kill anything in any of them, so pointless. I like the game but playing levels 2 & 3 over and over and over again is really boring at this point. Oh yeah, and good luck getting coins to upgrade. WAY TOO EXPENSIVE EVERYTHING! 2/5","I changed this to a 1 star and now deleted my original because I am disgusted by this business tactic. Don\'t buy the pass to remove the ads because it only removes the ads for the \\"season\\" which is like 17 days long. So every season you need to pay to get rid of the ads. It\'s not a 1 time thing. Very trashy tactic. Developer responded to my review with misinformation. First of all, I\'m aware of which ads were removed for when the pass was purchased. Second, the seasons are not 45 days long.","Love the challenging and strategic style of game play but like all other games like this, if you want to get past level 10, get your credit card ready, maybe two. You can always get a second job. Game makers don\'t care about 90% of the players. Prices are based on the 10% of losers who are willing to pay a thousand dollars plus to be the #1. To the losers who do that, thanks for ruining for everyone else.","No matter how far away I am from enemy attacks they still do damage. So I\'m basically just playing to lose. Great job on this game guys. And way to rip off all the enemy attacks from other games. Uninstalled and I wish I could get my \\"ad removing\\" money back. Spoiler alert, it\'ll still give you ads.","Enjoyable game for its genre. Has good graphics, decent upgrades. BUGGY. After 90 seconds, game lags to 2 frames per minute, then locks up solid. Good news is the game autosaves correctly and closes easily. But you will have to restart the game every 90 seconds on average."],"appId":"co.imba.archero","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.imba.archero&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.gamigo.ext.town":{"title":"Fantasy Town: Farm & Friends","description":"Build your vibrant town replete with talented citizens, plant a farm full of prospering crops, or produce valuable goods like milk and eggs on an animal farm!

Sooo much to do and unlock. This is a game you can play nonstop. NOT pay to win. Plenty of opportunity to earn what you need. Just wanted to let support/tech team know that there is a bug. When helping friends with trolls, you can click the three times initially, but the timed attack is not working. Other guildmates have had the same issue. Also, it would be a nice feature if you could flip the screen around when you like, instead of just at the start of the game. STILL 5 STARS!","Great visuals, cute and casual game. There are only two issues I have: one is the troll error (which sounds like the devs are working on), and the other is that there is no in game FAQ in the event that you need guidance. For example, I have leveled up to a point where I can access the \\"Premium apple trees\\", but I can\'t find them in the store at all. I\'m not sure if I\'m missing something but an online FAQ would be great to have for things like that!","The visuals are simple but adorable, the tasks are simple and the story is interesting and funny. I just have one problem and that\'s with helping your friends. There\'s this mission where trolls would be invading the town, and the player is supposed to have a boss fight. I got the first part of the mission out of the way with no problems, but when I try to start the boss fight, nothing really happens. I don\'t know if this is because the trolls mission is new or a bug but I want to have it fixed.","First off the overall gameplay is ok but there\'s lots of improvements that are needed like buying Items the time needs to be much shorter like I would say every 20 minutes instead of over an 1 hr. The other major issue is certain products should be made a lot quicker currently they take too long to make. I would give this game 5 stars but the game needs to be better improved.","I really love this game! People who complain about the tutorial going on forever, obviously have little to no patience. You can easily skip tutorials and the info is pretty useful anyways. It\'s like township but less complex, and the storyline is really fun to follow! I got this game yesterday and I\'m already level 12.. so maybe make gaining xp a little harder as you level up?"],"appId":"com.gamigo.ext.town","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gamigo.ext.town&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.playdigious.sparklite":{"title":"Sparklite","description":"Try Sparklite for free until the first Titan! \\n\\nSparklite is an Action-Adventure roguelite set in a whimsical and ever-changing land.\\n\\nGear up for Adventure and battle foes in top-down action using an arsenal of gadgets, guns, and gear.

My only complaints are that the controls can be poor (especially for the blimp bomb), the procedural generation is not varied enough to keep the maps interesting, and the game itself is quite grindy for resources to help push into deeper maps. That combined makes me play the game for a bit, then get bored, and months later okay it a bit more for a little while. Near-miss to potentially genius game.","Not a well designed game. Prices for upgrades are extremely high. It\'s more efficient to run straight to the casino and then reset than wandering the same ten map tiles fighting the same three enemy types. Basic enemies take off nearly half your life in one hit, even with upgrades. Many required tools aren\'t permanent upgrades but random drops. Hope you get a lamp this run if you want to see in the caves. And the lamp has three charges, so your walk into the cave is going to be a one-way trip.","Thank you so much for fixing the dualshock controller support! Now I can enjoy the game! I\'ve loved it from day 1, but the mobile controls were just making things way too difficult. I figured I\'d better check and see if it was fixed before I decided to re-purchase it on Switch, and wouldn\'t ya know! It\'s a very fun roguelike style game. Neat buffs you can find, and you only have so much room for them at one time, so choose wisley! I highly recommend this for retro RPG fans!","Top notch mobile RPG. Excellent controls that are simple and responsive, mechanics to match and from what I\'ve grasped of the story so far its all around one of the best mobile RPGs I\'ve played (And I\'ve played close to all of them, or at least far more than most \ud83d\ude02). I\'d easily rate this 6/5, definitely worth the 6.99. Or just have fun with the free trial, ( Don\'t kill the boss)","Absolutely fantastic game! Good leveling, good art, Great difficulty spike near the end. The only reason why I\'m giving it a two star is because I finally collected all of the notes and once I did the final song doesn\'t play! Was it a big MP3 file that got optimized out accidentally? I\'m on a pixel 6 pro.

Level 16 to be exact. The first boss is not beatable and all my tanks are fully upgraded, 4th star level on one and full gear while playing the other modes. Every game in this genre falls into the same category.. If the developers would make it so you don\'t just endlessly fail on one level, maybe I would spend more money. The VIP level details are also locked behind the first purchase. It goes from $0.99 to $5.99. Wish I knew that BEFORE.","Unplayable game. Freezes on level 4 every time you collect the first mech piece. Game acts like it\'s playing, but tank is unmovable, cannot progress to next level. The joystick still looks like it\'s moving but the tank doesn\'t move. I liked the idea of this, it\'s to bad it\'s not playable.","This game looked pretty good for the first hour. Now it crashes constantly, mid run, and of course, you don\'t get credit for the crash, nor do you get the energy OR the prizes for completion. This kills games fast, and this one seems no different. Avoid, unless you enjoy frustration.","Alright gameplay. Daily rewards stop at day 16. Adverts don\'t work 90% the time. No possible way to get certain tanks without paying. An option to bin cards and receive a new one would be nice. Same for a vendor who sells parts for coins or other surplus parts.","I took my 5star back. The game freezes and I\'ve been writing emails to the developers to assist after I\'ve spent a lot of money on the game but no assistance. Very disappointed with the developers for not paying attention to players. If you decide to play this game, don\'t spend any money on it...

Games are design to be fun and progress but to force loot boxes to power up is pretty dumb.","Suprisingly good take on the roguelike genre! Instead of being that portrait mode game, that there\'s thousands of nearly identical clones of, this game does the autofire system, with weapons/armor upgrade at the end of each stage, same as others, but does it in landscape mode, unique, innovative graphics, great home base layout, intuitive u.i. The whole game takes a popular genre, turns it on its ear, and totally nails it in the process! GREAT game. Very pleasantly surprised!","So far so good fast paced futuristic RPG style rouge like,thats easy to learn and hard to master.. I will be editing this review after I get deeper into the story (first impression) (Update) Do yourself a favor and play this game\xa1! It is still a work in progress but it Looks and Plays Great, excluding the small fact that the underground rental shop does not work yet, But just take it as a challenge and dive right into the game for a hardcore cyberpunk roguelike experience you won\'t soon forget.","I\'ve tried a lot of games that draw inspiration from Archero, but they all lack originality. This completely reimagines that game and makes it much better. I would definitely recommend this to a friend. There\'s a few things, such as about 1% of the time, when you clear a floor, one bullet wont get destroyed. We need a menu to see what upgrades we\'ve gotten during a run. Standing Shoot is the worst upgrade in the game(is just like damage upgrade except it doesnt work when you\'re moving)","Very fun and challenging. I\'ve played a few \'auto shooters\' because but this one is different in all the good ways. Its challenging but fair it seems. Only thing I am having problem with is trying to figure out where and how you get the memories. Is there like some kind of challenge you have to do? Like take no damage during a boss run?

I like being able to collect different things and upgrade, but to really get decent stuff, you may need to spend money for upgrades. It gets repetitive in terms of gameplay, and without real money, its slow to obtain gems and upgrades. I will state that it is a decent game, its free so can\'t complain.","Normally I don\'t rate games but this one is pretty amazing. The chain reactions make a huge difference in game play along with you don\'t find your self wanting to buy rubies for anything extra. Though once you start getting into the added maps or the daily you start running out of energy a lot faster because they require more then 1 a normal game eats up. But the ads don\'t pop up nearly as often on some other games which I truly enjoy. You only watch them when and if you want to.","Decent enough app, at least on the off chance that you can play it without insufferable lag. The gameplay of the game is, collect/ upgrade cards + collect/ upgrade equipment + timed levels where if you take too long your try was worthless, oh, and don\'t forget the near constant lag. It wouldn\'t be as bad if the whole game froze but no, instead the game keeps running and ignores any taps/ input. So, good job?","Really fun game, would be immeasurably improved by actually being able to play it for more than about 10 minutes at a time. Even with the first cap upgrade the energy system is just too stingy. Something like a zero-cost, zero-loot mine that grants energy for reaching the idol could go a long way to improving the issue, without hopelessly unbalancing everything? Right now it\'s mostly a game about waiting.","I actually like the first pocket mine compared to this one. the first pocket mine gave you challenges to complete and you were able to go deeper without limit a d there were no monster. this one has too much going on. there aren\'t any challenges. too many different levels that end too fast. and the only thing you really customize is your gear. it gets repetitive and boring. the graphics are nice but that\'s about it"],"appId":"ca.roofdog.pm3","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ca.roofdog.pm3&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.grand.survival.ocean.adventure":{"title":"Grand Survival - Raft Games","description":" Grand Survival  is a  marvelous survival game   with unforgettable experience! \\n\\nBrave an ocean full of mysteries and danger with nothing but your wits and your raft.

Clothing is really annoying to craft and doesn\'t last long for the cost. The reason I gave this game 2 stars is bc your character will ignore resources that you can be standing directly on top of bc the game prioritizes nearby enemies. It just will not let you interact with them at all, and it\'s maddening. Not interested in playing this game as long as this is an issue.","I really like this game compared to other survival games. Good graphics that are somewhat adjustable to save battery/memory. I like the cartoon-like graphics. It does need a little polishing. For instance, in your backpack when you have stuff on the furthest left slots the pop-up text is off-screen and unreadable. Controls get a little whacky when between zombies/crabs/whatever and resources. It\'ll target the enemy over resources and you can\'t get the resource until you kill the enemy.","All crafted items don\'t last long enough. Its a chore carrying 3 axes and 3 weapons to rubber island. Clothing or armor isn\'t strong enough. Glitches at the downed plane zombies are already dead. Go back to raft to depot, come back and they are all back roaming. Upgrades are too expensive when you can only get the gears at the hotel. Need better daily prizes for consecutive login. Gears maybe?? 20 to upgrade loom?! Movement is wonky. Good graphics though. It\'s worth trying out.","Update to my first post, don\'t know why it won\'t let me edit it. Upgrade my rating to 4 star from 2 star since they fix glitch with jellyfish. Again very good game with nice graphics. The only reason it\'s not 5 star is because I think the game needs just a few tweaks like other players suggested. Mainly for me it\'s the quick weapons and armor degradation, and the low energy. Wish they made your energy increase along with your leveling up. Anyway if you like survival games try this one.","This is a great game. There are a few bugs, for example, putting items in storage is really buggy. I have to open the storage multiple times, because it won\'t allow me to put items in. Also in the backpack I try to combine sets of like 2 and 3 peices of wood and it doesn\'t work. But other than a few bugs, it\'s a really good game. Good graphics.

However, there are many bugs within the game such as some ads that are watched to respawn not working after being watched. There isn\'t even a use for tickets inside the game (that I know of, correct me if I\'m wrong) and I feel that some levels are impossible for players who didn\'t grind.","To be clear I love this game. I know I gave it 2 stars but that is honestly because the game is not complete yet. I played the beta version of this and while this is much better than that one in many ways; it\'s still not finished. There\'s a lot the devs have to do. The movement/ attack controls are buggy. The loot drop system needs to be overhauled as I need to literally play one level 20+ times before a specific item will drop. This includes bosses. The cost of extraction is a bit too high too.","Great game. There are item drop frequency issues, stability problems, and minor control bugs, but I give it 5 stars because I know the game is a work in progress and updates are frequent. I am confident these things will be fixed. I played the Beta version, and it seems weapons can be upgraded much faster in this version....a very good change. Making most of the ads optional where the player is rewarded for doing so is great, too.","Excellent game. I cant tell if this is a sequel to the original or if it\'s a remake or what... but I have both versions installed & find them both to be great. Only issue I have is that I\'d like the controls to respond better. Very often it takes a couple button presses to start moving or to jump. As a platformer this seems like something that should be improved upon. But other then that, Very well done! Hey cool... I\'m from CT too. Keep up the good work fellow statesmen/women Lol :)","Played the first swordman in early development. There is no improvement. Not graphical, not performance, not feel for controls, not simplicity. I played through as many levels as I could handle but it\'s pretty much the same as the first game. I didn\'t enjoy the hand-holdy annoying tutorial that just makes you do things against your will without explaining them well (don\'t remember this from the first but they might\'ve implemented it later on).

Do you enjoy supply chain woes? Then this game is for you. Simple enough to start, but quite challenging pretty quickly. You think you\'re doing fine, then you run out of resources and it takes the next two hours to finish the last quarter of the mission. The story isn\'t great, and it gets grindy, but it\'s also a decent time suck.","This game is exceptionally difficult to control. Zooming in and out is almost impossible, even though it is a GAME CRITICAL NECESSITY. Even using my stylus for extra accuracy, the game will still select conveyor belts beside the thing you\'re trying to select AND THEN REFUSES TO DESELECT unless you move away and specifically select a grassy tile to force it to let go. Online help is pointless since the only results you are given concern REFRACTORY. Good game ruined by poor control.","still in the beginning stages but so far this is a pretty well designed crafting/survival game. the interface is extremely well designed and fluid and I\'m not fighting the controls in the slightest like I have in the past. even the design of the actual structures relieve the stress of building yourself into corners and making you redesign the most basic setups which of course makes it proportionately harder later on. it\'s reminiscent of factorio in its top down design but not stressful.","A good demo for a promising game, free version needs more content though. It wasn\'t long enough for me to determine if I would actually enjoy playing the full game. I\'ve played games like this one before where conveyor logistics were a major part of the game mechanics, and this one appears to address some of the issues that made those games tedious in the end, but once again, the demo doesn\'t let you explore the game enough for me to be sure.","I really enjoy this game, however I lost about 30 minutes of chapter 1, because the game doesn\'t have a back button or save button when you\'re actually playing in a mission, which I assumed meant it auto-saved. It doesn\'t. I just closed the game out not realizing this. But, you have to press the back button on your phone itself, then a menu will open to save the game.

Leave a review :)","comments":["Great game, poor customer service. Not sure why players are giving up by level 100, some of the options they want aren\'t available til 120- 200. So it\'s not the garbage they say, highly recommended game \ud83e\udd14. Side quests, events, \\"Hell Mode\\", castle gets bigger accommodating more heroes and towers. If you keep \\"grinding \\" which is the point of tins of games, it gets better. Don\'t listen to one person\'s opinion, and try it for yourself.","I\'ve grown weary of TD games that start out ok, then suddenly turn stupidly impossible at a certain level. So, this game caught my eye. User reviews made it clear that, while repetitive, you could advance and grow if you\'re willing to grind and watch some advertising. On this front, yes -- Wild Castle indeed is a game you can keep playing and playing, and I\'d like to thank the developers for this. If you\'re looking for a frustration-free TD game, go ahead and install it. But what needs to happen now is for the game to evolve so that there\'s more to do. In the game right now, with all the loot you earn from the perpetual grinding, you can upgrade your heroes, upgrade your turrets, and/or invest in various perks so that you can... uh you guessed it \u2026 keep grinding. The game is in desperate need for more ways to benefit from the work you put into it. How about more ways to design and develop your town, how about some adventures and campaigns, how about some events where you choose certain heroes to got toe-to-toe with certain villains, how about puzzles that we can solve for special rewards, how about the ability to occupy new castles and expand one\'s kingdom. Just anything to break the monotony. The opportunity is there, but right now, the game is just a repetitive dead-end, good for about a week or two of engagement.","It\'s so simple, I can\'t call it tower defense, but it\'s still very enjoyable. Waves of monsters roll towards your castle, and your defenders shoot them down. Upgrade to use more heroes, towers and archers, and enhance the abilities of the defenders and the castle itself. It\'s an endless loop, but it has stayed fun past level 300, so the devs did something right. Ads are optional, never thrust in your face. Recommended.","It\'s simple and repetitive. Can be decent while waiting at a doctor\'s office or something like that. Although there gets to a point where it\'s hard to improve and you feel stuck. Any improvement after a certain point comes in such small increments that tougher levels need way too much grinding. Also had to turn the music off early on. Just one song on loop.","The gameplay boils down to a never ending treadmill run that keeps going faster, but you earn points by running that you can use to increase your speed. Nothing really changes, and you don\'t go anywhere, you\'re just running in place. You have the option to watch ads and/or spend money if you want to put in less effort. You also can pay extra to have the computer run for you. Does paying a game to watch it play itself seem like an absurd thing to do to anyone else?"],"appId":"com.wildsky.wildcastle","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wildsky.wildcastle&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.com.tann.dice":{"title":"Slice & Dice","description":"Free demo, no ads, single IAP to unlock the full game.\\n\\nTake control of 5 heroes, each with their own dice.

It\'s a rogue like with what I can only assume is infinite replayability. There are LOADS of items and class upgrades that, when combined, can lead you to victory or ruin in so many ways. I would be willing to bet no two people have ever had the same run after they unlocked a twentieth of the items through playing the game. Keep it up!!","This game is terrific. The free install lets you play a demo, with the full game costing 7 dollars. So you don\'t have to take anyone\'s word for it. Give it a try yourself. I was impressed with the demo playthrough, and after buying the full version, I\'m even more impressed. Mechanically the game is simple but still requires good decision making, and the difficulty feels just right. As you progress you\'ll unlock more ways to deepen the experience. One of the better rougelites on Android.","This is one of the top games I\'ve ever played on mobile. The amount of variation and replay value is insane. Between characters, items, spells, leveling (you promote to new classes), modes, and difficulty, you get an incredible difference each game. I truly wish this game was still being worked on, but it\'s still 5 stars for me and will be playing this for years to come.","I love this game. It\'s exactly what I want in a turn based roguelike. One suggestion, allow players to skip the first 20 levels of curse mode by picking a bunch of curses and a boon. I can consistently get thru the first 20 levels, but it takes so long. I want to skip straight to the challenging bit.","Absolutely love this game. Have spent 30+ hours playing. One of the best mobile games out there. It has a steep learning curve if you\'re like me and too stubborn to read the rules at first, but once you get the swing of it it\'s very addictive and fun! Only one request: can there please be some kind of easily visible indicator that a dice is one that \\"must be rolled\\".

A few month later, after a long break: still a great games. Pros: The game excellently provides exciting fantasy adventure with lots of cool and funny moments, without taking away from realist tragedy befalling each world. Character progress is quite simple with time. Energy is not much of problem. Lots of story/sub-story. Your choice matter in the story. Cons: Is a gacha, be lucky. precise movement is a pain! The story difficulty spike","Overall I love it, but do have a few issues. The skill gap between player vs enemies gets to be too much to handle. Haven\'t been able to progress past the 2nd stage of World 11 part 2 because of this. There\'s also something wrong with the agora minigame in the Afterworld Inc. side story. I\'m certain I\'m selecting the correct evidence, but Charon catches me and I always lose anyway. Guess I\'m giving up on this part until the issue is addressed. Really do love this game, though.","Extremely fun game with many exciting and interesing things to do, if your stuck there are many ways to get over that, if you want better items, you can save up to trade things, if you don\'t have enough of something like gold or EXP theres something for that too! This game offers many rewards and possibilities, so you should definitely check it out!","So far, not bad... if overly simplistic. Took out a lv30 enemy with a level 18 character. Bow is super powerful. Edit: fast forward a couple of years. I haven\'t played in maybe a year, but the one before, I probably dumped $3k in, and totally enjoyed the game. It gets INTENSELY challenging, and it feels crazy having a max/EX character and still get stomped in story mode. I\'d say the game is very much worth playing!","EDIT: the game has started to freeze my phone up causing my system ui to crash and stop working. It happens everytime now and I\'ll start lagging during the worst times causing me to close app or my system ui stops working and freezes my phone. I\'ve Uninstalled game and even deleted a few apps even though I have enough storage. I love this game. Such cute graphics and the story mode is very enjoyable and interesting. I am having a lot of fun with this game.

Until the recent anomoly which lets you play old events (which I think is great!). 12 events, and you have to play whichever you choose 3 times in the less-than week it gives you for the highest tier reward. I worked hard, bought energy once, and still only managed two. It\'s too much for the short time limit :(","Probably near the best casual adventure/farming game I\'ve played. First and foremost, the story and characters are actually interesting! Secondly, the developers are very hands on with constant new content. They keep the story line moving at a consistent pace and make sure you get special adventures popping up a few times a month. You always have a little down time to gather energy so you don\'t have to spend cash though a little here and there supports the game and content! :) 9/10","When I tell you that energy runs out super fast, I mean SUPER FAST!! You get to play, literally, 5-10 minutes before not being able to do ANYTHING for at least 30 minutes. Maybe I\'m missing a way to get more energy quicker. No ads that I experienced, no bugs or glitches up to where I am, which isn\'t far. You can spend cash and prices are typical of mobile games, but you could spend alot QUICK. I just can\'t forgive the loss of energy unbelievably fast. UNINSTALLED","Great game and story lines. Exceptional customer service! I have been playing this game every day for two years and never grow tired of it. I have never \\"HAD\\" to purchase anything for any reason to keep going. This game has the most beautiful and vibrant graphics and there seems to always be a new challenge or island to keep it interesting. The characters become like close friends after a while. I really hope this game never ends!","Really love this game, the storyline and animation are top. Yeah it takes a while to get enough energy to really get going but once past a certain level there are so many options to get energy that you can accumulate quite a bit if you strategize. It\'s fun to play, defo 10/10"],"appId":"com.vizorapps.atlantis","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vizorapps.atlantis&hl=en&gl=us"},"tdcgame.zombie.idle.defense":{"title":"Zombie Idle Defense","description":"Hunt zombies and be a city king.\\n\ud83d\udc4dDefend against the zombie army\\nAn exciting, incredibly dynamic and terribly atmospheric strategy game with RPG elements that give you hours of real pleasure, and allows you to enjoy thoughtful gameplay.

Constant leveling and plenty of gear to pick up. But then like most of these games, you hit that one level that drastically increases the difficulty, your enemies have exponentially more highpoint than the previous level, and the only way around it is to spend money. It\'s a shame, this could have been a spectacular game. Then something funny happened. The developers actually listened to feedback. They fixed the issue And improved the gameplay. BRAVO!","Buggy, with some design flaws. It\'s mostly just grinding, but I enjoyed it. It does taper off lamely where there\'s little to do in the late game, so I quit. There is one character that specializes in weapons that don\'t seem to be offered except as $5 cash purchase, but generally everything else seems to be accessible. It is designed to get you to watch tons of ads by rewarding you for each one, but that seems fair.","I love this game! It\'s very addicting and I only have 2 stages left, all characters at S level and many guns almost at epic level. I enjoy seeing the progress and also playing idle mode gives you so much more rewards. I\'d definitely like to see more maps and different types of events. Currently I\'m having an issue. I was playing on one phone and it died on me. Just got a new phone today and my progress is lost as well as all the app purchases I made. Please help me to restore my account.","Not a bad game...but not what it says on the label (-2 stars). You have to work through 30 levels before you can get to any sort of \\"idle\\" growth, and most progress still has to be made with actively playing the game (-2 stars). That being said, the game is pretty entertaining, if heavy on the \'pay-to-win\' side. The controls and gameplay are fairly simple, the weapon upgrades are reminiscent of a merge game, and there\'s still enough free stuff to not make you feel like an ad slave. (+1 star)","I would give it 5 stars if there were more levels. I believe that if I had been patient enough to keep replaying levels, I could have saved more real money. Even at the pace I played, it didn\'t take much to reach the last level in 10 days. Once you beat Las Vegas and London, each day you get a Hero chest to augment what you have. As I said, patience to repeat levels can really save you real money. It is a fun game that is similar to a Tower Defense game without the placement strategies."],"appId":"tdcgame.zombie.idle.defense","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tdcgame.zombie.idle.defense&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.xtt.iasurv2":{"title":"Idle Arks: Build at Sea","description":"\ud83c\udf0aOnce, a sudden flood submerged every town.

You can\'t click away from her. There\'s no option to remove ads, and the \\"watch ad\\" crates are more prevalent than actual resources. Not worth the time.","I downloaded this app a few years ago and really enjoyed it, I changed phones and forgot about it until yesterday. I had been playing for a few hours and had built 6 rafts, I go to start the 7th raft and the app completely glitched. It asked me to submerge even though there was nothing built. It then froze. I restarted it a few times and the survivors where floating around. It would freeze on the welcome back screen. I uninstalled and reinstalled, lost all my progress.","Its alright as a game if you are trying to get rewards from another game, but if you aren\'t there isn\'t much of a point. It can get pretty grindy, and if you aren\'t patient you still have to watch ads. :l Luckily most are skippable or you can just exit out of them by pressing the back button. There are also a few typos but its still alright.","The game itself isn\'t bad honestly. My main issue is the \\"achievements\\". Once you do complete any of them, you have to watch an ad to claim your reward. It feels more like rewards for ads, as opposed to rewards for actually getting the achievement. I\'ve never seen a game do this, and I hope I never see one do this again","The game was a pretty great time killer, had a lot of progress, and overall enjoying the game. The main issue I had with it was when I had to transfer to a new phone.

Ads are not too invasive unless you want to get something extra. Even gems can be obtained without paying money: you just have to be a bit patient. Kudos to developers! One issue is that once you advance to the next region, you can not get trains for the previous one except if you spend a lot gems. Those are very expensive (in terms of time or real money) and with each purchase you only get a small chance to get the trains that you miss, which makes it even more expensive.","Train WRECK Station still. Game crashes frequently. Doesn\'t matter what I\'m doing or not doing, game crashes frequently. Doesn\'t matter if this is the only thing I\'m running on my phone or switching between this and other apps, game crashes frequently. Game crashes in all phases of game play. It\'s a train wreck. Typical developer, won\'t try to solve their bugs, just asks to be contacted via a support email, chat, etc. \\"Please tell us what the problem is.\\" The problem is described above.","The game has been fun. Sometimes it can feel a bit repetitive but all games can get that way. One BIG issue is with the balance of grey locomotives and parts awarded. You almost always get grey parts and it makes new regions difficult when you can\'t upgrade other colored engines due to a lack of parts. Makes earning keys a waste of time due to only grey engines & you sell for grey parts. Balance needs revised. I\'ve spent nothing on the game (level 207) & there are ways to earn lots of free gems.","It\'s a good game and I do enjoy it but I wish it was closer to the original train station. collecting hundreds of different types of wagons was my favorite hobby on it. although I do enjoy playing the special events more on this one. like the American railway project where you could earn several locamotives that I liked the look of. And I apologize for my original review being disrespectful, I like the game and I didn\'t realize till now that you can upgrade the amount of trains you can run.","If you like trains, as I do, this game is awesome. It is a laid back game that is truly entertaining. You can collect resources without the fear of someone raiding your station before you upgrade something. The Regions are well designed, with exquisitely detailed background scenery. The physics of the trains navigating the tracks is extremely accurate. Sometimes it seems to take forever to complete Jobs, but that just gives me time to do something around the house. Highly recommend.

While it is mainly an Idle game, you are able to unlock a mode that allows it to be a fullly fledged game. The controls are responsive, the graphics look nice, the text narrator is funny, the puzzles are nice and complicated and there is a lot of content to keep you busy. That content isn\'t even just busy work as it helps your main goal progress further. My only issue is with the garden and the fact that you can\'t automatically restart when you wish too.","I loved this game, i played through most of it once and i decided to come back to finish the story. Now theres way more ads than before. Ads everytime it opens, ads while i placing survivors to tasks, ads telling me to go watch other ads to get rewards. I get mobile games have ads but i dont need them swarming the game while im reading important story.","I love the concept of the game along with the good story. The biggest issue with it is that after installing and playing it the game freezes on the storyline and won\'t let me click the button to continue and when i try to re-enter the game it never loads me in and forcing me to uninstall because it is unplayable. Same thing happens for tinker 2 so I don\'t know what the problem is.","I\'ve played before, tried again to see if it changed, it didn\'t. Ads, and so on, yeah it\'s free but, the progress is extremely slow, you\'re also lucky if your survivors don\'t die before you find more. I love the concept, the story is pretty neat. The options and chances make it pretty interesting, but if you want true success you need to pay. It\'s a phone app. Either charge for the game or make it 100% free. Stop this in app purchase bull****... uninstall... second time....","I like the game while it\'s actually working, but it lags pretty badly after a bit... a short bit. Like 10 mins. I have a relatively newer phone, too, so I doubt it\'s something to do with my end. The lag makes it difficult to drag cards around, view the map and the flower garden is... buggier than a bug bomb could fix! I\'ve missed out on quite a few of those gemdactyl things, too. Without the lag, this is a rather nice game. I just wish I didn\'t need friends to enjoy certain parts of it. :/"],"appId":"com.kongregate.mobile.tinkerisland.google","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kongregate.mobile.tinkerisland.google&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.FunFlavorGames.HeroPark":{"title":"Hero Park","description":"Welcome to Hero Park,\\n\\nthe place where magical unicorns attract heroes into your town for their own little adventure.

The town is empty and the once glorious dungeons are now abandoned. The decision is clear: the town must be rebuilt, new monsters bred and the dungeons populated again.\\n\\nCreate the perfect illusion of an adventure town with busy blacksmiths, bustling taverns, and glorious dungeons with monsters bred by you. Meet fascinating characters who want to join you and use their skills to lure the hero\'s gold out of their purses. Make Hero Park what it used to be: the most magnificent town in the kingdom!\\n\\nFeatures:\\n\u2605 More than 100 fabulous characters: heroes, shop keepers, vampires, unicorns and more\\n\u2605 Design your town according to your wishes and automate your production\\n\u2605 Breed monsters for your dungeons and shape them according to your needs\\n\u2605 Immerse yourself in the magical world of elves, humans and dwarves\\n\u2605 Experience the exciting story of an old war hero and his unicorn\\n\u2605 Solve exciting quests and loot valuable treasures...\\n\u2605 ... and stop your unicorn from eating everything!\\n\\n\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nFrequently asked questions (FAQ)\\n\\n\\n1. How can I have the heroes trained?\\n\\nThere are several ways to increase the chance of training. It is especially helpful if the hero has bought an experience potion (yellow potion) beforehand. The chance of training is also increased if the hero can defeat a high level monster or defeats several monsters.\\n\\n\\n2. How can I have a hero blessed?\\n\\nA hero wants to be blessed after having his suffering (e.g. diseases caused by undead monsters) treated in the temple. The different blessings are only valid for certain races. So in the beginning only one blessing is available for elves and it can be helpful to attract as many elves as possible to the village.\\n\\n\\n3. How can I reduce the charging time of the unicorn energy?\\n\\nThe recharge time can be reduced by up to 10 minutes. This is done by ranking daily tasks (from level 10, up to 4 minutes), Santa\'s brother (from level 11, 2 minutes) and using the unicorn trainer (from level 20, up to 4 minutes). With Santa\'s brother there is also the possibility to produce unicorn food, which can be used instead of energy.\\n\\n\\n4. How can I delete or reposition a building?\\n\\nSelect a building and open the building menu with the button in the upper left corner. Select \\"Store building\\". If you now want to move this building somewhere else, click on an empty field and select the building from your storage. \\n\\n\\n5. Can I find improvements in treasure chests for employees who cannot be found in treasure chests?\\n\\nAs soon as an employee is on your team, you can find improvements in treasure chests with the same probability.\\n\\n\\n6. I can\'t get any further with the task \\"In your village you need 10 cats\\" and need a tip?\\n\\nThis task can only be solved at level 28.

This is the story of you, your unicorn and a treasury full of gold!<br><br>Five years after the Great War, the old war hero and his faithful unicorn return to their home town and find that not a stone is left standing on another. The town is empty and the once glorious dungeons are now abandoned. The decision is clear: the town must be rebuilt, new monsters bred and the dungeons populated again.<br><br>Create the perfect illusion of an adventure town with busy blacksmiths, bustling taverns, and glorious dungeons with monsters bred by you. Meet fascinating characters who want to join you and use their skills to lure the hero&#39;s gold out of their purses. Make Hero Park what it used to be: the most magnificent town in the kingdom!<br><br>Features:<br>\u2605 More than 100 fabulous characters: heroes, shop keepers, vampires, unicorns and more<br>\u2605 Design your town according to your wishes and automate your production<br>\u2605 Breed monsters for your dungeons and shape them according to your needs<br>\u2605 Immerse yourself in the magical world of elves, humans and dwarves<br>\u2605 Experience the exciting story of an old war hero and his unicorn<br>\u2605 Solve exciting quests and loot valuable treasures...<br>\u2605 ... and stop your unicorn from eating everything!<br><br><br><br>-----------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Frequently asked questions (FAQ)<br><br><br>1. How can I have the heroes trained?<br><br>There are several ways to increase the chance of training. It is especially helpful if the hero has bought an experience potion (yellow potion) beforehand. The chance of training is also increased if the hero can defeat a high level monster or defeats several monsters.<br><br><br>2. How can I have a hero blessed?<br><br>A hero wants to be blessed after having his suffering (e.g. diseases caused by undead monsters) treated in the temple. The different blessings are only valid for certain races. So in the beginning only one blessing is available for elves and it can be helpful to attract as many elves as possible to the village.<br><br><br>3. How can I reduce the charging time of the unicorn energy?<br><br>The recharge time can be reduced by up to 10 minutes. This is done by ranking daily tasks (from level 10, up to 4 minutes), Santa&#39;s brother (from level 11, 2 minutes) and using the unicorn trainer (from level 20, up to 4 minutes). With Santa&#39;s brother there is also the possibility to produce unicorn food, which can be used instead of energy.<br><br><br>4. How can I delete or reposition a building?<br><br>Select a building and open the building menu with the button in the upper left corner. Select &quot;Store building&quot;. If you now want to move this building somewhere else, click on an empty field and select the building from your storage. <br><br><br>5. Can I find improvements in treasure chests for employees who cannot be found in treasure chests?<br><br>As soon as an employee is on your team, you can find improvements in treasure chests with the same probability.<br><br><br>6. I can&#39;t get any further with the task &quot;In your village you need 10 cats&quot; and need a tip?<br><br>This task can only be solved at level 28. Once you have cats in your village, remember that all cats need love.

It\'s more like an idle game than something to play actively. Early on, there are some interesting building portions. After that, the main gameplay is completing challenges, restocking resources, and hero improvement. That does not drive me to keep playing as the challenges are meh. There is no combat to directly influence and the \\"city building\\" part is pretty bare bones. If there was an incentive to keep playing, the energy system is pretty low payout.","The game starts out at a good pace with fun mechanics. Once you hit about midgame and the unicorn statue unlocking, everything becomes an exponentially longer wait with no way to scale \\"the business\\". You\'ll think \\"ah. This is just the plateau to cross and there is more features coming in leveling up the castle. Let me spend a few weeks building 1.5 million gold and the next unlock will be for 2 more additional heroes instead of just 1. \\" no chance at that. Slow goes the boat. Disappointing","This game appears to be quite simple, but as you level up, more and more features unlock. I think a number of other reviewers would have benefited from being able to see what unlocks with levels. The castle is a game changer as well. It would be nice for all the random tips to be listed somewhere, like a hero might buy a different staff than listed. That\'s a big deal for quests, but not obvious unless you\'re watching closely.","My only complaint so far is that I can\'t find, or there isn\'t, a button to instantly swap between buildings. Update (1/21/20): No other issues so far. Occasionally they\'ll have some really sweet deals if you take some time to understand the value of each piece of the game. Absolutely ZERO popup ads which is always wonderful. Very easy to play, and restricting enough to keep you from playing TOO much in a day since it\'s very easy to lose track of time playing it, lol. Great game, never deleting.","The game is decently fun with an interesting storyline, however, the lack of shop variety is kind of disheartening. Everything takes quite a fair amount of gold to level up as well. It feels grind-y. I do love the art style and the game itself does not pretend to be anything other than what it really is I would like to suggest adding Champions that require goods/monsters/treasures to be a specific level for them to visit. Give us some goals other than quests, please. It would be appreciated."],"appId":"com.FunFlavorGames.HeroPark","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.FunFlavorGames.HeroPark&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.tiedan.game.EdgeOfDoom":{"title":"Edge of Doom: Zombie Crisis","description":"Story background: After a terrible Resident Evil broke out, the world became a wasteland.

","comments":["There are way too many ads, I watch an ad then when I\'m opening a box 10 seconds later there\'s an ad. There\'s also noway to increase energy as far as I know. 50 is too low because some of the levels have a lot of 2 or 3 hit block things. The rest of the game is good, being able to customize the museum is a good Quality of Life addition.","So first let me turn off saying this is a fun idle game. I enjoy digging up the fossils and a sense of Mystery behind it because you never know what you find. It\'s not hard to understand how to play the game, the music is nice and the features such as poses and skins make for a nice touch. However, I have a hard time using the map, if you can. The only way I know how is by leveling up and because of this I recently ran into a glitch where I\'m leveling up faster than normal and skipping dig sites","Overall this is a good game I like digging for dinosaur fossils and putting them in a museum. And you can change the poses and add skins to the dinosaur skeletons (I mostly use the skins to hide the incomplete dinosaur skeletons). But I can\'t find the bones that I want. For instance, I can\'t find the archaeopteryx head and arm at 3 star quality. Please fix.","This is a very fun game. I enjoy getting all the dino bones..... However, my game started crashing randomly a week ago. No biggie as it\'s still a work in progress. Except now it can do anything without it crashing. Go to dig - crash, go to lab - crash, just open the game - crash. Will give a 5 star as soon as fixed.","I love the game, the digging, the graphics, all the little things you can do, etc. However a horrible bug that should\'ve been fixed long ago is the ads. You have the choice to watch them when you run out of moves and a lot of times it won\'t give you rewards after you watch them. It\'s extremely annoying. Would be 5 stars if not for this huge issue"],"appId":"com.tapps.games.dig.dinoquest2","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tapps.games.dig.dinoquest2&hl=en&gl=us"},"online.limitless.appleknight.free":{"title":"Apple Knight: Action Platformer","description":"Apple Knight is a modern action platformer with precise touch controls, fluid movement, and smooth animation.

The ads aren\'t intrusive, they give you one if they die after a long time In the game and everytime you complete a lvl. The problem is that the game doesn\'t save until AFTER the add. I complete a lvl and if I accidentally click an add and it takes me away from the game, I click back in and progress lost and if an add waits a full minute till the x shows and you go out and back in, redo the lvl :/","Fantastic platformer! There are several worlds, each with it\'s own environment and series of levels. Each world has it\'s own feel about it all while leading to a big boss at the end. You gain loot so you can buy new weapons, skins and some abilities to customize your hero. When you get to that point where your hero is unstoppable there is the ultra hard mode where one mistake will stop your run, so speed runners and cassual players can get their preferred experience. Excellent job team!","Great time killer, the controls are easy to use, great graphics and gameplay. I would rate it 5 stars if it weren\'t for the add glitch where the x button takes a long time to pop up and my progress would be lost, but other than that Great game, If you\'re bored this game is what I recommend playing.","This game is lots of fun with options for gamers of all levels. It\'s a platformer, so the controls really need to be very tight (i.e., precise), and the developers did a solid job with that. Plus, it has controller support(!), which takes it to another level for me because of the tactile experience of buttons. The game is free with ads, but the number of ads isn\'t too overwhelming, and you get quite a bit of rewards for watching, especially if you do so voluntarily. Overall, a great experience.","Game\'s got it all. Great sidescrolling platformer, controller compatible, HIGHLY recommended!! You don\'t have to watch ads, unless you choose to, and any in game purchase, even just .99\xa2 removes adds. As for in game purchases, most of them can be bought with either real money, or coins from the level, making relatively few items behind a pay wall. Ads, and micro-transactions are by choice only, and not necessary. So it\'s not only a GREAT platformer, but really considerate of players!

Used to play pretty regularly, and would even willingly watch an ad now and again, but now they don\'t give me a choice; there are ad pop-ups with no button to close except the one to watch the ad. It\'s unfortunate. Ever since DECA took over, the player experience has really suffered. Changes are made that clearly make watching ads the only really way to progress or play the game. Save yourself the heartache and move on.","So I like the game but it\'s now broken because I cannot progress at all. Every time I reopen the app to try and progress, the aeon gates is stuck and I cannot abandon the gate even though the timers at zero and my other gates just keep resetting to the last time I open the game. I\'m trying to force update the game and see if that fixes it. If not then I\'m just going to uninstall and not bother with it. Problem has been fixed with an update.","Great gameplay with steady sense of progression. Each of the heroes can be upgraded in multiple useful ways. The menus are clear and easy to use. There is NO paywall that prevents enjoyment once you reach a certain point, though there are cosmetics and boosters you can buy if you want to. The art style is humorous, colorful, and clear. The devs are also steadily improving and adding features to make it interesting for both new players and veterans. A fun clicker game with meaningful choices.","I love this game a lot, and have easily spent a few hours in the past week upgrading various characters and unlocking as much stuff as possible. I\'ve been able to upgrade every character to Epic so far except for Lia. For whatever reason, the game crashes every time I attempt to upgrade her, and as a result, she\'s still stuck at the Common level. I\'ve sent the error reports, as requested, but nothing has come of it. I just want to be able to use Lia, but she is too low-level now to be effective.","This game was great. I literally played it every day and have played it for so long. However they recently updated where if you lose on a boss you are automatically sent back levels. This means even when not playing and you lose you will go back. Very frustrating to get so far and then not be able to sit there and not play the boss to earn upgrades. unfortunately after being very dedicated and playing a lot. I\'m going to have to uninstall."],"appId":"com.beesquare.almostahero","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.beesquare.almostahero&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.RetrostyleGames.LastPirate.deadthieves":{"title":"Last Pirate: Survival Island Adventure","description":"Survival and Pirates in free pirate adventure simulator!\\n\\nYour survival started on the lost island.

This is 100% better than the other raft/survival game. The game has tons of content, better graphics, and it\'s not stingy with items. Controlling movement, targeting, and building UI can be tough..but thats common with all mobile/tablet apps. This is a 5-star game regardless of the platform. ---edit--My inventory just vanished. Please restore my items. I do not want to craft all my items again...and several stacks of other materials.","I don\'t like that it erases your entire inventory of items every time you die. Even of things you\'ve already built. It\'s pretty impossible to get a good thing going if you have to start from scratch every time (and be forced to go reclaim your \\"lost\\" items wherever you died, starting from the origin point on the island to boot!) Not a great game for me. Would be otherwise.","It\'s a fun game. A question for the developers: am I supposed to be able to upgrade my boat house past level 3? The paper by the entrance lights up but there are no options like before. I\'m not sure if it\'s a glitch or that\'s all I can do Edit: there hasn\'t been any response from the developer. This game is full of loads of glitches. After grinding forever to get into the dungeon, the results were super underwhelming, and there was really nothing left to do. There\'s also a church for no reason.","Love the game in general. However one thing that would help out some is more of a tutorial in game. Or shorts scripts for items. There isn\'t much to find on internet about it. For instance what is the green bottle with red dot that appeares on the screen randomly. One other thing that may hold interest longer is to possibly have more to explore. Maybe different areas after different levels. A way of panning out would be good too, some areas are just to close up, especially in bushy areas.","Overall happy, a few minor things. When I upgraded from camp 2 to 3 the second floor changed height. So the chests I put up there went through the floor and now hang on the ceiling. Not an issue as I can still access but disappointing, the loom also went partially through the floor. It seems like there should be a level 4 as the stats weren\'t maxing and the paper still glows blue but I can\'t interact with it anymore."],"appId":"com.RetrostyleGames.LastPirate.deadthieves","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.RetrostyleGames.LastPirate.deadthieves&hl=en&gl=us"},"jp.oridio.museum":{"title":"TAP!

Ads aren\'t intrusive and they give helpful boosts, game play isn\'t limited by an energy meter, and progression isn\'t very slow either.

Ads are uncommon and short. Money might be tight in the beginning but you\'ll soon be generating money faster than you can spend it. Any of the items bought with gems are single use and are a minor benefit at most, in other words, totally unnecessary. Its cute and fun and basically the perfect mobile game. Has everything you might want in a mobile game without any of the problems that other apps suffer from!","It\'s a fun little clicker to pass time, and they\'re right, I do enjoy trying to guess which dinosaur it is on every dig, lol. I\'m playing the Play Pass version, so there are no microtransactions or ads, which makes the experience a lot more enjoyable (gem purchases are free, just time-locked). Only downside is some mechanics aren\'t very well-explained, you just have to kind of figure them out through trial and observation. Not sure the point of all the tools, upgraded pickaxe handles everything.","Great game, but its way too repetitive, you\'ll keep digging until you complete a skeleton, then rinse and repeat. The only fun part is trying to guess the dinosaur before you complete it. Other than that its just a really simple and easy game that will make you addicted for a few days and will be boring after which leads to uninstalling the game.","This is in a top ranking class amongst very few mobile games. I\'m a total sucker for dinosaur stuff and this is fantastic I adore the look of the pixelart dino fossils, the gameplay is enjoyable being a mix of digging and museum design, the placement of ads is outstanding compared to some of these billboard trash heaps in the playstore and the choice to watch for a reward is great!

Let us know what you think of Day R Survival by leaving your review.","comments":["So addicting. Almost no ads. Only the ads make flashing screens. Easy on the eyes. No sexual content. I love the lack of explaination, or excessive story line. Just wake up in the thick of survival. Free to play. As challenging as you make it! I got my boat stranded in the ocean right away. I have to wait till next spring (in game) to retrieve it. I MUST GET GREEN HOUSE. Homestead is where the heart is.","I still remember when this game was in it\'s early stages, and how far it\'s come! A story line I can get behind and various challenges and companions you can meet in your journey keeps the game fresh and exciting! With this new combat system they have, has also added a bit of strategy in how you approach every battle! With the addition of villages you can now get materials and items you may have had trouble getting in the past! Def a must download if you love survival games,especially post apoc!","*Meanwhile in Russia* But seriously this is way better than other mobile survival games I\'ve played, not sure what exactly makes it better but it\'s definitely worth your time. It manages to outdo games that need 10x the storage space AND an internet connection. One thing that might improve this game is a chance to loot backpacks and things, I have a tendency to keep practically everything I find. Then again, I do that alot.","Good detailed game. Hard to play if in One Life mode. Update to post is it\'s a great game and better than any other. I have learned how to upgrade and use recipes for weapons, outfits, and to make iron and steel. Using easy premium mode from two years old account. Started playing two months ago and I am on level 89. I have been on life saving mode about ten times and I don\'t lose anything but that one level. Better game play and user interface on my android tablet is better than on my phone.","Edit: when the level system was added some time ago, I had just recently earned blacksmithing and had poured resources into it, but my progress was rolled back so I couldn\'t craft anything anymore without doubling my current character level. That was a huge bummer, still kind of sore about it too. But that aside still a good game and improving regularly. Maybe make some other ways to farm exp than just fighting and daily missions. It\'s not consistent enough."],"appId":"com.gm_shaber.dayr","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gm_shaber.dayr&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.dawinstone.b2be":{"title":"Bad 2 Bad: Extinction","description":"\u25c6 Caution\\nYour data will be reset if you change your device or delete the game.

The minigun makes you stand still and you die quickly because of it. Equipped weapons and gear shouldn\'t take up backpack space, because they\'re not in the backpack, they\'re equipped. There\'s a few errors in spelling and grammar as well. It doesn\'t tell you there\'s a chance to lose guns when combining them either.","This game is good, but there are a few things that can improve. There should be a way to reduce the effect/duration of stun and poison; there should be an option to revive with 5~10 dias next to the watch ad option; and there should be a cancel reload button. I\'ve been looking for a loot shooter that wasn\'t a one-handed roguelite, and this one works well. I especially enjoy the attachment system. Overall a good game, albeit flawed. Still recommend picking this up. No forced ads, which is a win!","Amazing 2D shooter game with a hint of 3D gameplay. The depth in attachments as well as equipment and bonuses from them is very balanced. The number of guns is sufficient along with the characters you can assign to your team. The flare is a great part of the game, Waves are there to give you resistance but calling in all the waves at once can end the resistance faster and can stack damage so the more enemies in line of fire, the more collective damage you can do with the same ammo. No complaints","This is a great game, it really is. It has a logical and likeable story line, the characters are cool, the wilders are an interesting kind of undead enemy and the enemies are awesome, the amount of guns and weapons system to the game is great and logical, same with the fighting system and the world map, but I just have a few complaints. Could you add different reloads to different guns such as a magazine removal and attachment animation for magazine fed guns? the reloads are a bit dull.","First of all, very good game. The gameplay is really fun and there aren\'t very many mobile games out there like this. But there are a few problems. First of all, it crashes alot. Mostly when I bring up a GUI or start a mission. I also have a complaint about the gorilla character. I love apes and monkeys but the gorilla looks horrible. I only wish that the eyes were a bit smaller and the chin was more defined (The nose Also juts out for some reason like a cliff edge (Also more primates please)"],"appId":"com.dawinstone.b2be","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dawinstone.b2be&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.superplusgames.oos":{"title":"Oceans of Steel","description":"Jump on board!

Ads are everywhere. You can\'t open certain things in the hud without an ad, can\'t leave a location without an ad, can\'t look at your inventory without an ad, and the microtrans prices are absolutely insane, $14 for a virtual car? $9 for a blinged pew pew that eventually you will have to replace. Great game, bad marketing.","I went from level 67 all the way down to level 23. Lost all of my gear and progress. Have repeatedly reached out to support but no response. Please fix for a higher rating. Stop your ads from killing people!!! When I am in the middle of a mission I click on my backpack and an ad pops up when it\'s done game crashes and sends you back to town at 20hp. Even if you have 150hp it will send you back. Very frustrating. The game would be great if it didn\'t crash so much(like every other ad)","So far the game is enjoyable. Controls are pretty good. The real downside so far is the ads for bonuses as well as to sell to the merchant for reasonable prices. I don\'t mind ads when they are used to keep the game free. However, I purchased the $5 no ads pack and still continue to receive ads. I have email their support and will update after I receive a reaponse","It\'s fun to play (when you can!). Between the overwhelming adds,and if something happens when you\'re in the middle of a task, you start out with very little life and losing everything you worked for. Would love to just play a game that they are not trying to constantly get you to buy stuff! I\'ll probably end up deleting this game a second time! Hard to enjoy and have fun when you\'re concentrating then you have to watch and skip an add...every other move! Very frustrating to say the least!!!!!\ud83e\udd2c","It\'s a really fun game, surprisingly detailed for a polygon game. But there are way to many ads! It\'s so frustrating trying to do stuff in the game cause there\'s an add every thirty seconds, or you have to watch an ad just to talk to someone or go in your backpack. This would be a 5 star game if it wasn\'t for the overwhelming number of unnecessary ads"],"appId":"com.aldagames.zombieshooter","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aldagames.zombieshooter&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.dreamgate.steampunktower2.android":{"title":"Steampunk Tower 2: The One Tower Defense Strategy","description":"Steampunk Tower 2 is a unique tower defense game for free set in the alternative Steampunk universe. \\n\\nThere is a dragged-out world war with the enemy never seen before.

During battles: when you upgrade a tower there is no indication of which towers are the strongest. You have to select each individual tower to see the stats. I also wish you could select for certain towers to ignore units, such as wasp only attacking air at certain times. At base: when upgrading units there is no indication about what the parts are doing. It\'s too easy to recycle upgrades, should have to confirm. Interface is a bit cluttered.","Fun game play and excellent graphics. Translation to English is mediocre. I\'ve currently been stuck with a game breaking bug where I can\'t tap any icons and I\'m stuck at the base view. I can\'t open any other screens, can\'t open the map, any buildings, or anything at all except the wheel spin minigame. Restarting my phone didn\'t fix and now I\'m totally unable to do anything.","Interesting game with simple mechanics and a slow pace (best to play no more than 20 min/day). It takes a real hit in playability, though, because mobile was made to have a very small view of the battlefield so when you get to mid game enemies are regularly shooting at you from off screen and you have to guess where they\'re at with your super shots. Watching PC replay vids it\'s also obvious the shortened field of view has made the bonus levels needlessly difficult. Overall it hurts the gameplay.","The concept is great however the game needs balancing. The resources of gold and etherium are to easy to get, however parts to upgrade the guns are way to hard to find. In addition, you have to have a certain experiance level to upgrade your buildings to move forward. However I have completed all of the side missions (which give experiance), and one only pops up every 8-12 hours. At this rate it could take me weeks to get to the next level. I cant even buy my way out! This is a true game flaw!","The gameplay, defending your tower, is pretty good. Moving turrets to the middle to quickly reload in-between waves is fun. Just one problem though, when you don\'t have enough fuel for a mission, you\'re (mostly) stuck waiting half an hour or more just to play the main part of the game. Never mind the long construction times, never mind that you have to spend premium credits just to use your super weapons after the first free use, I could\'ve given the game four stars if it weren\'t for the fuel mechanic."],"appId":"com.dreamgate.steampunktower2.android","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dreamgate.steampunktower2.android&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.datavisionstudio.roguelike":{"title":"Heroics Epic Legend of Archero","description":"Collect legendary weapons, level up your hero, choose new skills, and rip through legions of monsters!\\n\\nRun, shoot, explore, and become stronger.

Each game costs 1 key and you only get 3 keys lol! Each upgrade is random, and the good upgrades you will get literally once every 10 games lol! Some of the maps they intentionally make impossible to win on. The levels scale up ridiculously fast from easy to impossible in only one level. It\'s a joke how impossible they make it so you have to pay. If they would have made it playable, I\'d have paid for it...","An extremely fun game, map design could use some work. As a lot of times the hardest enemy seems like the terrain. My main gripe though is you cannot see ailments applied to your player. You can see it when applied to the enemies, so why not your playable character? That is my main reason for 4 not 5 stars. Overall fun game and anyone should give it a try.","I play a lot of these games and this one just makes me say \\"ok, I see what you did there.\\" the characters speed is just slightly to slow that you get hit by things you probably should be able to avoid. the enemies bullet speed is just slightly to fast and you\'ll get hit. You can\'t always tell when the enemy bullets will hit a wall or go over. it\'s things that makes me think they did it on purpose so you die and speed money on power ups. Which I understand they are a business and want to make money. it feels scummy tho. it\'s hard to describe but in a lot of other games, when you get hit or die, you feel like it was a fair death. in this game, I just die and don\'t quite know why. That can all be forgiven because I like a challenging game and I don\'t mind spending money, my biggest complaint is the amount of ads there are. for an example. you can watch 6 ads to get the 6 main resources for upgrades. they don\'t give you enough during the missions. it feels like playing 3 missions gives you as much at 1 ad. then they have \\"epic\\" chest that you can watch 6 ads and unlock 1 chest. even if you get a good item, you\'ll have to watch more ads to get the gold to craft it. but you\'re in luck, you can buy a pass for no ads.. for a week or 2 weeks or 1 month. no options for a 1 time buy. The ads are also difficult to close out of. sometimes they play for 1 min and no x will appears for another 10 -15 seconds. if you click anywhere on the screen it will take you to the google page. when you go back to the game, the x still wont show up sometimes. A few times I was unable to exit the ads and had to close out my game and I didn\'t get credit for watching. You\'ll spend more time watching ads than playing the game.","Developers deleted my review, so I will elaborate... The game itself is fun! But that fun is limited, as the ads are aggressive, by sometimes locking you into them and you\'re unable to leave the ad, which means you have to close the game and lose progress. The no-ad purchases are greedy and TIME LIMITED. I\'d happily pay a one time small purchase for no ads, but that should not have a time limit to it.","I really like it, so far. A perchase for no ads is very very helpful give you lots of free stuff and it\'s not expensive. But if you want you can watch lots of ads instead to get the same items. Ive played just one day and it\'s my top three favorite game. I hope \ud83e\udd1e it stays that way. Update: I\'ve been playing two weeks now. I still really like this game. I have confirmed that it is far better to remove the adds and support the developers with inexpensive purchases, free is a lot of ads to watch"],"appId":"com.datavisionstudio.roguelike","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.datavisionstudio.roguelike&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.ctugames.km2":{"title":"The Wild Darkness","description":"Inside a forest on a mysterious world...\\nA sorcerer is casting a spell in the dark.\\nOnce the ritual was complete, a streak of light fell from the sky.\\n\\nThen you regain consciousness in the middle of a strange forest.\\nWhere...

It is rather fun, I must say, even with its difficulty. Much to explore, much to discover. I recommend getting some extra cash, though, to at least be able to have 1 Revival Ahnk, and better remains. If not, well, good luck; you\'ll be needing every drop of it once you begin, trust me Sweetling.","I really really enjoy this game. But I have an issue when I save a game and reload it later. There seems to be something missing when I come back. I have had multiple bottles of water missing from my inventory and I have had my fire pit gone and I don\'t have enough stone to rebuild one making it very difficult. These aren\'t the only two instances of this happening, although it\'s not every time. I hope the creator sees this and takes a look into why this happens.","The Wild Darkness, is a very challenging survival game for the strong minded who is willing to sacrifice it all in order to defeat the all the bosses. You must survive Diseases, The elements, against curses and magics, Random game play, unique monsters; fantastic game with a great art style and game play. Warning: for those willing to play if you die then you will most certainly lose all your progress. It\'s all part of the hard frustrating-painful fun to achieve the unachievable.","This game is an incredible rogue like survival game. The difficulty in the beginning had a definitive curve that lessened with each play through. The 4\u2606 review would have been 5, but I feel the devs are catering to those that whine too much. Food was very scarce prior to the update, which made several totems and strategy paramount to survival. After the update, I seem to find food in every container & blade of grass. I admit to wishing food was easier to acquire; however, it is TOO easy now.","I really loved this game at first, amazing concept, cute animation and fun gameplay but when you die, you lose your whole game-save. I was super disappointed and unhappy about this, it\'s hard to survive in this game and having to lose all your progress after dieing once is very angering. I wish at least you would lose all your inventory items, or maybe have to die 3 times to lose your progress instead of this. I would have given a 5 star review if you didn\'t lose your progress when you die."],"appId":"com.ctugames.km2","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ctugames.km2&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.Kraken.TinyWorlds":{"title":"Tiny Worlds: Dragon Idle games","description":"Your main mission, if you\u2019re up to it?

A HUGE update is available with a new Event and a lot of changes! Here&#39;s the changelog:<br>- New Summer Event! Collect watermelons to unlock the Leviathans!<br>- New pet animations and VFX<br>- Pet passives reworked and pet levels capped at 10<br>- Big game rebalancing to suit the above change<br>- New Pet UI page and sort options<br>- Eggs are now also collected within the offline rewards<br>- Numerous quality of life changes<br>- Various bugfixes","comments":["The game is great. Its got great graphics, theme, gameplay and etc. But there are 2 complaints... 1: it takes WAY too long to level up... why do you need to wait 2 seconds until you go to next world? Fix this and it would make me very happy. 2: there are some ads that are a entire minute long!?!? And also sometimes it makes me rewatch an ad to get the reward... Other than that, its great! No forced ads, no popups asking for money though if I could I would donate (sry).","This game is super fun! I keep it open sometimes just to get the presents as they go past! And the collection of eggs is very fun! I do wish there was more things to do in here though. Like side quests that will cycle through after you complete each one versus daily quests or more runes to collect. The events are amazing but I wish they were more frequent and I\'d really like more things to collect besides pets! But otherwise I love everything about this game and excited for what\'s next!","A decent enough game. Honestly the only reason it\'s not a 5 star one is because some of the mechanics feel very unfair. It\'s really frustrating when you miss downing a boss level because you pets are coded to move every few seconds and you lose that dps as they fly to the other side of the cube. Also absolutely pay to win, but you can still make decent progress if you don\'t.","The game itself is fun for an idle game, and progression is fast. My biggest issue (and the reason for the rating) is that ads often have multiple layers, all of which have up to 30 second timers before they can be skipped and still get rewards. I\'ve had multiple ads I\'ve had to wait 2 or even 3 30-second timers for to skip, and even then I have to fight the pin-sized button to actually skip it and not just open the app store by accident.","This game has a good concept and is fun to play. It has fun art and is relatively simple. However, it can be a bit complicated to understand at first. The dragons are a fun concept but aren\'t really functional to the game, as you can move forward quicker if you don\'t upgrade them. Also, I wish there was a way that you didn\'t have to go all the way back go level 75 when you \\"reset\\" levels. Maybe if you\'re far enough ahead, go back to the closest 100 level? Just a thought.

If you\'re killing time and on a WiFi connection it\'s passable. I\'m changing my rating to 1 star. It\'s only playable if you have WiFi, you spend more time watching ads than actually playing, and once you start leveling you have to lose roughly 3-4 matches before winning 1, unless of course you want to pay to win.","wasn\'t what I thought it would be, but that doesn\'t mean it is t as great as it is. there\'s still a couple things wrong which will happen with any game, but I really like the clean layout and gameplay. first of all I think there needs to be more cards, which I think the game devs are working one second, which will be big, maybe add a 3d model for when the cards hit each other? third, make the buff for having the same kinds of cards together more powerful.","This is a good game. My only issues are that coins and upgrade cards seem to be few and far between as you move up the ranks. also the amount of coin it takes to upgrade from blue to purple is high at 1k. The last thing is that the battles are still somewhat automated even when not using auto battle. I wish i had more control over which of my cards attacks when.","so i think the game is super fun and i really think that yall have a solid base that can be fine tuned and improved to be a super fun game. i just wish some of the mechanics were a little more thought out like being able to organize your cards to be able to see which characters belong to which faction. or put them in order based on their attack or health. this would be a big improvement and start to make the game a little more competitive. also different multiplayer modes would be nice too.","I\'ve only been playing this a short time. For someone looking for an in depth tcg this is not really you. This game is basic atack/initiative/health, and then each card character has a combo skill you do not control. Despite this I still give it a solid 4 because its smooth running, f2p is a valid option, and even though its basic as far as a tcg, Im still able to enjoy it for what it is. I would recommend to a casual player."],"appId":"com.noxgames.shadow.deck.card.ccg","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.noxgames.shadow.deck.card.ccg&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.pixelbite.ga2":{"title":"Reckless Getaway 2","description":"It ain\u2019t no cakewalk topping the most-wanted list.

I like the destructive aspect of it and it works well to let some steam off. The only thing I would like to see is more ways to spend the coins. Thanks to Google PlayPass, I have unlocked 95%of the vehicles so I really have no use for the coins now. It would be nice if we could buy powerups with the coins that you normally get from getting the purple question marks when playing the game. Overall fun game though.","this game has so much potential. i love the graphics, the driving is amazing, and all the vehicles are detailed in a way so you know what there are, one problem is the missions for each vehicle, and with that some of them are just way too tricky or can be impoosible. It can really cause players stress. other than that, there is nothing wrong with this game. Great job Dev.-Lil19","This is my 100% honest review, and I must start by saying I really do love this game a lot. The controls are nice, I like the auto gas idea as it adds to the challenge, I like the different vehicles you can get and the maps are cool, especially the farm. Ive completed nearly every challenge decently well and with practice... Except the flaming bike... Thats too hard imo. My one main issue is the car buying system... Did 50 draws and got zero new cars... So much time wasted. Overall good game!","Very fun. 84 different cars to collect, ranging from combine harvesters to sedans, this game has literally everything. Very easy to control, the maps are really well put together and the cars chasing you are really interesting, like cop cars and SWAT vehicles, tanks and hummers. You can collect power-ups, one is an explosion that knocks back every car around you, one is a mode where you are invincible and break everything you hit, and the last is jump boost. There are challenges, too.","Excellent concept with great potential. I love the run from the police concept, but I am disappointed about the upgrades, levels, achievements as they do not enhance gameplay. The controls are pretty painful and cumbersome. Your car will damage quickly and wreck within the first minute. Get different a different car doesn\'t help! None of the cars stay straight despite the type of cars that you can easily get because the coins are given so freely.

With plenty of content to boot with no predatory microtransactions. Why the low rating? The controls are horribly placed and lack configuration. It\'s genuinely hard to input the right key they\'re so tiny. With the ability to reconfigure and rescale controls, this game would be 5*/5*","Space Marshals 3 is an awesome game! I\'m a huge fan of the previous two Space Marshals games. The game seems to run better after Chapter 3 was released. In some parts, the game runs smooth at the highest graphics settings, but still suffers from reduced frame rate when the level is larger and more populated, even on high-end devices. Still, this did not deter me from playing. In my opinion, Space Marshals games are the best games on Google Play. They are fun, captivating, and have a great story.","I was super hyped for Space Marshals 3. I made it through Chapter 2 and had been waiting in the release of the next install for months. While I like the continuous nature of the story, I was disappointed that I went through Ch 3 so quickly. The challenges got more intense towards the end but bummed I beat the game & there isn\'t anything else to do in it. I hope there is a Space Marshals 4 coming. I haven\'t found a game that comes close to this one.","The game is so slow and glitchy that it\'s unplayable. I had it on my old phone back before part 3 came out and it worked well, an awesome game it was. Now, on my new phone, it\'s just so buggy and glitchy and slow that even if you spend the 20 minutes to get the first level to start, you can\'t do anything because it doesn\'t register your commands and then the game crashes. Pity, I did love the game.","I know that Space Marshals 1 was a premium game, and 2 had the premium upgrade for more checkpoints and exclusive unlockables... But I was really expecting more than 2 levels. You get to play the tutorial + level 1, then the rest of the game is $8 and an extra $3 for bonus bounty hunts. I would have rather been told to pay $8 up front, then had the option for the $3 expansion. I believe that first level doesn\'t give enough time for someone to decide if they enjoy the game."],"appId":"com.pixelbite.sm3","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pixelbite.sm3&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.biglime.cookingmadness":{"title":"Cooking Madness -A Chef\'s Game","description":"PREPARE \ud83d\udd2a, COOK \ud83d\udd51and SERVE \ud83c\udf55 delicious meals from all over the world \ud83c\udf0e in Cooking Madness! \\n \\nBecome the master chef \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udf73 you have always wanted to be!

Performance optimization<br>2. Bug fixed<br><br>Enjoy your journey in Cooking Madness and thanks for playing!","comments":["Some of the levels are specifically designed to be nigh on impossible unless you\'re willing to grind for coins or pay. Other levels (especially the timed plate ones) can sometimes be unwinnable entirely or 100% left up to chance (such as where the customers \\"stop\\" in their walk, as this determines how quickly you can begin to fill their order.) It\'s a fun game on the surface & the different environments are very interesting but it\'s so transparently a game designed to get money out of you.","I have to edit my review unfortunately. I\'m over 100 levels in and I can no longer say this isn\'t a pay-to-win game, which is a shame bc it IS very fun. I absolutely HAVE to buy \ud83d\udc8e in order to advance bc I\'ll be a mere 2 coins or 4 likes away from a goal after playing the same level several times. I have so many coins now I REALLY wish you could spend them on anything other than restaurant upgrades. You should be able to buy a booster with them at the very least. It takes way too long to earn \ud83d\udc8e","Easy and fun, not too difficult or stressful. All the ads weren\'t annoying until I paid to get them removed and still get ads to get double coins, mysterious gifts, etc which why am I paying to remove ads, but I still have to play ads to get bonuses or to instant upgrade my stuff? Definitely not a fan of that. If someone is paying to remove ads, then remove all ads \ud83d\ude44","The game is fun, nice design and graphics. However the flaws, so many ads it\'s insanity. I get it being free and the ads are what makes it that way but after everytime I finish a round and then if I want double coins I have to watch another one. Way to much! Secondly once you finish a restraunt level and make it 3 stars you can\'t even go back in and play it to make some extra coins for upgrades, or just practice to get better ext. May get deleted due to ads being to much.","This game is surprisingly decent for a free to play game, with the stipulation that you pay $1 to get rid of the ads. There is an energy system but your energy only depletes if you fail a level, and that\'s not super common. Some levels are hard and can take multiple attempts, but there are also ways to get infinite energy for a set duration of time. After playing 260 levels on this game, I have a lot of premium in-game currency as well, so I could buy help if I needed it."],"appId":"com.biglime.cookingmadness","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.biglime.cookingmadness&hl=en&gl=us"}}');var c=o(2734),d=o(7357),u=o(5861),g=o(6886),m=o(6242),p=o(3965),y=o(4267),f=o(5113),b=o(4410),w=o(9960);const v=l;function k(){(0,c.Z)();return a.createElement("section",{className:i},a.createElement("div",{className:"container"},a.createElement("div",{className:"row"},a.createElement(d.Z,null,a.createElement(u.Z,null,"Anything missing?
