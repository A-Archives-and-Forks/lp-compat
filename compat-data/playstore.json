There are numerous moments in-game where your assistant manager pitches in with advice which can help. The complexity does impede on gameplay too much for me but worth a try if you're a fan of this type of management in your football games. After giving it a go am sticking with NSS as there is just way too much to deal with here.","I never leave in actual worded review on anything but I have been playing this game for quite a while now and it's amazing. To anyone saying you need to buy cards to keep up, I just beat Champ league brentford while still in league2 with a 35 avg team. It's not easy by any means, but its possible. Like any team game, just know who your Strikers are, make sure every player gets at least some playing time, and pick and choose who gets training and when. Great game overall!","The game is extremely fun. The amount of stuff you have to take into account can be overwhelming, but it's a good challenge. The game play is good as well. Dribbling is kind of awkward because you have to pull back but then it's hard to stop and pass without going into shooting mode and hitting cancel. Progress through the bottom league is good, but the moment you get promoted your toast. You have to buy players because you'll barely get any scoring attempts in the second leave with you mid 30/low 40 players. You loss and everyone will be unhappy. I'd be willing to buy a pack, but the 1, 2, or 3 players you'd get for $10 will not make a difference with the rest of your squad being so low and not having any depth.","Good game, ruined by need to buy cards. Been playing nss for years and played this one now and then. The gameplay itself is great and hard to put down when you get into it. However, I am sick of losing by 1 goal no matter how many I get and all concern bars filling up, leading to poor play and losing key players after a few seasons. The entire experience and team frustratingly falls apart after a few good days play and is basically a waste of time.","Honestly great game but it still has its flaws. One is that you can't bend the ball nearly as well as you could in new star soccer. This makes it nearly impossible to hit free kicks and honestly this causes free kicks to put you in a worse situation. It piles defenders into the box and with no way to shoot you have to pass and hope you can get a scoring opportunity with 7 defenders in the box. But besides this and having to tank the second season because you aren't anywhere near good enough to be where you get promoted to this game is great."],"appId":"uk.fiveaces.nsfc","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.fiveaces.nsfc&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.pixelbite.xwt":{"title":"Xenowerk Tactics","description":"Play the first part for free.

I'd love to be able to edit the squad formation or at least make em closer or further apart. Runs smoothly n looks great I wish I could zoom in a greater amount to enjoy it more. An the invisible enemy stages in the beginning are brutal without the cage shield n other abilities. It's been challenging, I like the world map and its random events.","Overall good game! Devs would you look into the pathfinding? Sometimes when I DoubleClick a spot one of my ops will get stuck somewhere... Also different environments in the woods when we have to engage and kill monsters... I don't like the auto-shooting... Maybe you guys could have an option to turn it on/off?? Game looks really good! No lag or crashes ... I have my game settings on high and it's doing amazingly! 😊 one more thing, could you add a normal mode? Only easy & hard available atm...","Games actually disappointing. I got interested in this game due to another game they produced, Space Marshals 2. That, absolutely love so let's see what else they got. The mix of old school 80s animation and computer graphics, does NOT work here. Plus random events via cards, it should simply happen and not be a card draw situation. A better way to have a functional tutorial and yet be a \"make sense,\" in game flow: have people in the team do backstory missions. You see their abilities.","Enjoying and engaging gameplay. You gear and deploy a 3 man squad (maybe more later in game?) The squad members gain random useful traits/mutations as they level up. Many of these are very cool to use. In a more expensive game I would ask for more classes and maybe branching weapon selections for the squad to add more strategy but as it is, its a great experience for the price. I also am a fan of using the cards to showcase most of the information as they do most of the time here.","I paid for it after the demo period thinking there would be more substance, but there isn't. I find that there are too few enemies and too few abilities to really change things. It has a gameplay loop similar to XCOM with combat being more fast-paced. Easy was a bit of a mindless slog. Turned it up to Hard (there is no Normal), and the randomized abilities cause a lot of early game forced losses as it becomes too easy to be overwhelmed and you don't have any abilities to do anything about it."],"appId":"com.pixelbite.xwt","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pixelbite.xwt&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.pixelbite.mutant":{"title":"Xenowerk","description":"Be the last hope against the mutant infestation.

It has micro-transactions (which I despise) but they were done correctly and not at all a nuisance. The gameplay loop is a solid, pick up and play for a few minutes one. The only reason I give it 4 stars is that all the levels are essentially visually the same. They're detailed and look good though, so it's only a minor complaint, frankly.","It's a great game, well it has potential to be great, 1. Missions need to be more hands, longer, and have better adjectives. 2. You should be able to buy (or earn) teammates to aid you. 3. It's currently boring how easy the enemies are to kill plus there's not many of them. 4. Just add some stuff like sas 3 did, well good luck with the game and keep at it.","Pretty awesome. A twin stick shooter with equipment upgrades. It works out of the box with my USB-C controller, and I couldn't be happier. It feels like a proper top-down action RPG, bit you can literally pick it up and clear a level with only five minutes to spare. Easy to pick up, have a minute of fun, and quit. Haven't even seen a single ad. This is not your usual Android store garbage.","The first time a free game wasn't shooting ads in my face every 10 seconds. Gameplay is reminiscent of Alien Swarm. It doesn't hold your hand, you might actually have to use your brain to pathfind through a level. The difficulty is fair, all around, looks like the kind of game that's worth someone's time. Makes me want to actually support the dev.","I enjoy this game. Graphics, game play, items/weapons leveling by experience gained from defeated aliens all well done. Only area I would immediately improve is what I can see while I'm playing. For example, the camera is close down to the level, which I like especially the destructible environment and details like writing on walls, desks, etc. However, sometimes when moving backwards away from the enemies, shooting at them, they'll be off the screen, can't see what I'm aiming at."],"appId":"com.pixelbite.mutant","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pixelbite.mutant&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.noxgames.hex.civ.strategy":{"title":"Hex Polis: Civ Medieval War 4x","description":"Hex Polis is stylizated turn-based strategy game.

Fun Civ-esce feel but also with its own originality. No complaints on ads, as the rewards justify them (which can be quite short at times). Only thing I think: lower the price of certain packages and I will gladly pay. I want to feel like I'm getting MORE than what I'm paying for. It is, after all, digital 🤪 Overall: this game keeps my attention, for now. Lol","I absolutely love this game! Not a pay to play. Reminds me of the original Warcraft game style and energy.Great pace of play as well as a balance in upgrading. Please keep up the great work. Any chance of a one time remove all ads option?","I enjoy this game quite a lot, but I have a few critisisms. Unit previews don't show how far a unit can see. A unit with 2 sight nullifies the effects of watchtowers. A unit's standing animation usually slants to the side, making telling what tiles you can backstab from a bit awkward, if not worse because you can't take back movement options you select, meaning you can't try a side without commiting to it. Those are my gripes with the game.","Do not get this game. You play through levels so short there's barely any point to playing them. Its a naked money grabbing rip off of polytopia. The facing system really sucks, your guys spawn with their back facing the enemy so you get back stabbed straight up. So many things to pay for, its just awful. Don't waste your time.","This is a grueling obvious rip off of polytopia accept worse atlease it takes a few minutes to go through a round of polytopia in this I can barely get a few upgrades before my beginner unit bodies the enemy I think a larger scale map would be a huge improvement and tiles that slow but don't block units similar to what a game called unciv does"],"appId":"com.noxgames.hex.civ.strategy","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.noxgames.hex.civ.strategy&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.noxgames.mage.hero":{"title":"Mage Legends: Wizard Archer","description":"Roguelike super wizard RPG - Become magical archero and slay monsters in multiple dungeon battles.

There are ads for everything, and eventually the ads cause the app to close itself. Also, your pack prices are ridiculously high and they're not even good. No one will be paying $99.99, $199.99, or $399.99 to begin with, but you seriously think the reward of one item and handful of gems will entice anyone? Pure greed. Also, you have to grind so hard to get such little amounts of gold. I have so many scrolls I can't use to level my gear because of the tiny reward.","I can't wait for the city. I have to say this is a lackluster attempt in the shooter genre. It can't even get what it has copied, what every game in this genre slavishly copies, right. There is no progress counter so if you are taken out of the game you must start the chapter completely over. Some rooms repeat, some bosses repeat, even the hint of the day never changes reminding you to stop to shoot. I wanted to experience the unique city bent but I can no longer stand the game enough to do so.","04/30; fixed! 4/29: thank you! Updated 04/28 to say there's been 2 updates (at least) since my review and the Desert stage is still broken. Shielded enemies in level 46 don't register so you can't attack them and now they can't attack you, meaning you have to quit and waste what you earned. Fun, but stage 3, level 41-42 is bugged and you can't kill the enemies in it, stopping progress. Would like to give it a shot, but needs more equipment and the levels fixed","Better than Archero because equipment allows you to choose what abilities or skills you want to have. However, progress is painfully slow and equipment too hard to come by. The forge is pretty crappy. It only makes stuff I already have our don't need. Should be able to choose to try making a weapon or ring at the very least. Keep improving! Lots of promise.","I have been playing a lot of rogue-like shooting lately, and this game has more ad then the other simulator games like this one. I know you're trying to make money , but who wants to play a game that every powerups or free gears and have to wait 30 minutes to it. I know the simulator game doesn't add more ads then this game. Like the graphics,games play with different lvl powerups, and stage. I don't know the game save or if there is a way to save your game. Anyway that's my opinion when I play."],"appId":"com.noxgames.mage.hero","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.noxgames.mage.hero&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.gonzossm.sttt":{"title":"Suрer Toss The Turtle","description":"BLAST.CO shop is back in business, and the competition has just risen to a whole new level!

Amazing visuals, easy goals to strive for, small micro transaction that you really don't need to help you progress in any way , no constant adds and if there is a add they reward you for watching with in-game currency to unlock more characters. It might be simple minded distance game but it's perfect and more mobile developers need to take notes","I love this! The upgraded weapon criteria. The animation redraws that feel just as charmingly nostalgic as the original. The only request I have is to add the option for the original song from the flash game to be an option to turn on. Like a Music Selection Button. The original song made me feel more like a space adventurer and I loved it. For old times sake, Gonzo. Please? Best wishes on every aspect of life, Kyra. (Agent K)","Very fun, has a huge number of creative unlockable characters besides the turtle, everything from a dolphin, a cat, a watermelon, and even a saiyan-like \"fruitian\". There are also good power-ups like the UI inspired super instinct. It has ads but they are built into the game in a way that doesn't ruin the experience.","You only watch the ads if you want to it's not forced. It only gets you skins for the character you play. This used to be an old flash game back in the day so it has nostalgia for me. Same thing and repetitive just make it a little further every time and get up grades not much skill needed but for a free game this has a lot going for it unlike others.","The game is addictive, the gore may not be for everyone but I think it's the best part! I keep shattering my highscores when I least expect it and thankfully it's not just another pay to win game, and once it starts to pick up you really make some cash and get the next best upgrade. A great way to pass the time, can't get the ad for 20 shells to work for some reason but I guess that's the best part, there's like no ads whatsoever!"],"appId":"com.gonzossm.sttt","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gonzossm.sttt&hl=en&gl=us"},"com.pixio.google.mtd":{"title":"Summoner's Greed: Idle TD Hero","description":"You, the greatest and most powerful summoner, broke into the King’s castle and stole his priceless royal treasure!

But after seeing the funny meme-y ads, I gave this game a shot. So far, it's been really fun. Everything about this game just seems like smart mobile game design. Instead of playing ads after each wave or whatever, it gives you the choice to get rewards by watching ads. After losing a wave, you can either replay it or start over but you keep your summons' levels and can relocate them. Kudos to the developer. I'm impressed.","First of all, The ads for this game are adorable and finally broke me into downloading and playing it. So it's an adorable little tower defense that lets you build up over the course of several playthroughs of the waves. Lose on wave 10, start over and move your units that you summon around. Or you can try again with a buff and see if that's enough to push through. I'm enjoying it :)","Pretty fun so far! Edit: with probably more than 20 hours into this game, I have nothing but good things to say. It's a fun \"tower defense\" game, with ample rewards through your progress. The game can get tough, but you're allowed to try again or back up some rounds. The ads are always optional, but do tend to be short and with a nice reward, so I rarely turn one down. 5 ⭐ / 5 ⭐ Great Game! Edit: I spent many hours on this game, and now I'm back. I'm hoping I'll get Monitor's rewards!","It's a fun game when you have the time to spare, I've always loved tower defense's. The cute simple art style is great, in the future once I've played more I hope to see creatures with just a (little) more design details but not a complaint. It's fun, thanks for making the ads for the game funny and honest, it did the trick. Lol","I decided to give this a try because the ads for it were pretty funny. All in all, it's a nice little tower defense game, but that's really about it. I think it would be better if wave progression continued even when you don't have the game open, and it notified you when you hit a wall, so to speak. Also, evolution items seem to be cash-only. Never a good idea. Maybe they're offered once you clear a certain number of waves, but that goes back to the game not progressing unless you have it open"],"appId":"com.pixio.google.mtd","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pixio.google.mtd&hl=en&gl=us"}}
