    Some apps can be easily patched with Lucky Patcher to get free in-app purchases, while others cannot.
    Offline games are usually compatible, while games with heavy anti-cheat or online games are usually incompatible. However, there are a few exceptions!

    For more information about what Lucky Patcher can do, see this link: 
    <https://flixbox.github.io/lp-compat/docs/lp-info>

    We have already compiled a list of many compatible games here: 
    <https://flixbox.github.io/lp-compat/>
    
    If you would like to add your own games to the list, you can use the \`/addapp\` slash command. To use this command, simply type "/" into the chat and click the black ðŸ˜‰ emoji.
