# Lucky Patcher - Important information

## What is Lucky Patcher capable of?

Lucky Patcher has the following capabilities:

- Create backups of system and user applications.
- Emulate client-sided In-App Purchases.
  - Unfortunately, server-sided In-App Purchases can not be emulated.
- Remove unnecessary/unwanted system applications.
- Convert user applications to system applications and vice versa.
- Install and uninstall modded/stock Google PlayStore.
  - Modded PlayStore allows you to automate application patching and bypass license/signature verification.
- Apply customized patches made by other users on applications that have one.

## What should I know before and after using Lucky Patcher?

- Signature verification bypass may not work on every application that includes it.
- Blocking advertisements is not possible on some applications.
- Emulating In-App Purchases on some applications, offline or online, may not be possible due to server-sided payment verification.
- Some custom patches are outdated and will only work up to a specific version of the application.
- Lucky Patcher is not universal.
  - This means that not all devices are capable of patching the same application(s); rooted or non-rooted.

## Issues that you may encounter during IAP emulation:

- Infinite 'loading' loop.
  - This can range from being stuck in payment verification (server-sided) or your phone can't patch said application.
- Message like "Invalid Purchase" or equivalent.
  - This happens when the emulation was (and is) unable to pass the server-sided verification.
- Application restarts and reverts any changes made.
  - This is a result of an anti-cheat implemented to the application by the developers.

## About root

- LP usually works fine without root.
- If you decide to root your device, be aware that you might be unable to use some apps on the device.
- There is no "catch-all" root guide. A good starting point is [XDA Forums](https://xdaforums.com/) and Telegram groups that specialize in rooting specific phone models.
- With root you'll be able to patch the Android system and Google Play, which means that you usually won't have to patch individual apps.
