# Update an existing app

When you reinstall a patched app, it will no longer be signed with its original signature.
This means that the app can no longer be updated via Google Play.

If you want to keep the app's data (like your in game progress), you can:

- download the new APK file from a third-party site like APKPure.
- open Lucky Patcher
- go to the Rebuild & Install section
- Navigate to the location of the new APK file (usually Downloads)
- Patch the APK just like the original app
- Instead of reinstalling the app, simply install it as an update
