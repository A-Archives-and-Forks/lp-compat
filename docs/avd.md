# AVD

AVD lets you run a virtual Android device on your PC. This will even allow you to root this virtual device quite easily.

[Here's a tool that can easily install AVD and root it on your PC with a few clicks](https://github.com/freeload101/Java-Android-Magisk-Burp-Objection-Root-Emulator-Easy).

Don't be overwhelmed by the amount of options, just ignore the ones irrelevant to rooting. Open the tool, install the virtual Android device, and press "Root AVD" to root the device.
